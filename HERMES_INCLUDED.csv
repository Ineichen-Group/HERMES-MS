Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease whose pathogenesis combines all these processes. MS also involves impairment to the balance between the components of the intestinal microbiota, with development of dysbiosis. Various probiotics are widely used to correct dysbiotic conditions <e2><80><93> bacteria with proven useful properties. We report here the use of a model of multiple sclerosis <e2><80><93> experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) <e2><80><93> to study the ability of the probiotic Enterococcus faecium strain L-3 to decrease disease severity in rats when used alone and in combination with glatiramer acetate (GA). Administration of E. faecium L-3 was found to decrease the severity of EAE in rats to essentially the same extent as GA. However, simultaneous use of probiotic enterococci with GA produced no protective action. It is suggested that these agents stimulate different components of the immune system, as their actions produce increases in different populations of immune cells circulating in the blood. The study results demonstrate the ability of E. faecium L-3 to produce significant direct and indirect (via correction of dysbacteriosis) influences on the immune system in MS, which allows these bacteria to be regarded as a potential agent for immunocorrection in autoimmune, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative disease.",10.1007/s11055-017-0484-1,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11055-017-0484-1,"IEB, WZ, PH",1,NA,EAE,rat,Wistar,male,NA,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,90,1,2,20,0.3,3.7,30,0.5,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Abdurasulova_2017_NeuandBehPhy,JOUR,7,glatiramer and probiotic agent and animal cell and animal experiment and animal model and article and bacterial strain and cell population and cellular distribution and clinical effectiveness and controlled study and disease severity and dysbiosis and Enterococcus faecium and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and flow cytometry and immune system and immunocompetent cell and male and multiple sclerosis and nonhuman and rat and real time polymerase chain reaction and treatment outcome and treatment response,English,1573-899X 0097-0549,866-876,47,NA,"I.N.

Immunomodulatory effects of atorvastatin and/or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) were determined in previous studies. The present study was set out to investigate the synergistic effects of combination therapy by suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and ATRA in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. EAE was induced by MOG35-55 in female C57BL/6 mice. Therapies were initiated at day 12 post immunization when the mice developed a disability score and continued throughout the study until the day 33 when animals were sacrificed. Therapeutic treatment with half doses of atorvastatin and ATRA in combination has synergistic benefits causing the regression of clinical and neuropathological features of EAE more favorable than treatment with full doses of either drug alone. Without any advantage in anti-proliferative effect, combination treatment significantly reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-17 and conversely, increased the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 more prominent than either drug alone. Furthermore, FoxP3+Treg cells were significantly increased only in combination treatment.

J.",2018,J Neurosci,Reduced Microglial Activity and Enhanced Glutamate Transmission in the Basolateral Amygdala in Early CNS Autoimmunity,"Emotional dysfunction is common in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and in mouse models of MS, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE); however, the etiology of these behaviors is poorly understood. To identify CNS changes associated with these behaviors, we focused on the basolateral amygdala (BLA) because of its central role in the regulation of emotional behavior. Whole-cell recordings were performed in the principal neurons of the BLA in early EAE, before demyelination, T-cell invasion, and motor dysfunction. EAE female mice displayed increased frequency of mEPSCs, with no alteration in amplitude or evoked EPSC paired-pulse ratio compared with controls. We found an increase in the AMPA-NMDA ratio and dendritic spine density, indicating increased numbers of glutamatergic synapses. We saw similar electrophysiological changes in BLA principal neurons after microglia were either inactivated (minocycline) or depleted (Mac1-Saporin) in the BLA. Microglia regulate synapses through pruning, directed by complement protein 3 (C3) expression. C3 was downregulated in the BLA in EAE. Ultrastructural analysis of microglia revealed more complex ramifications and reduced extracellular digestion of cellular elements. We also observed reduced IBA-1 and CD68 staining and lack of proinflammatory cytokine expression in the amygdala. Thus, early EAE is a state of microglial ""deactivation"" associated with reduced synaptic pruning. This contrasts with the prototypic microglial activation commonly associated with inflammatory CNS disease. Additionally, these data support a role for the acquired immune system to influence both neuronal and microglial function in early CNS autoimmunity.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Microglia help regulate synaptic homeostasis, but there has been little evidence for how this might be important in neuroinflammatory diseases. The data from this study reveal increased synaptic activity and spine density in early stages of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (an animal model of multiple sclerosis) in the basolateral amygdala, a nucleus important in the types of behavioral changes we have previously described. These electrophysiological and morphological effects occurred without significant elevation of local inflammatory cytokines or local demyelination. Unexpectedly, in the context of inflammatory state, we found that microglia were ""deactivated."" This study provides strong evidence for a link between microglial activity and synaptic function; the conclusions contrast with the generally accepted view that microglia are activated in inflammatory disease.",10.1523/jneurosci.0398-18.2018,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.0398-18.2018,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,9,Minocycline,control,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Acharjee_2018_JN,JOUR,42,"Animals and Basolateral Nuclear Complex/*immunology and Complement System Proteins/immunology and Cytokines/immunology and Dendritic Spines/immunology and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*immunology and Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials and Female and Glutamic Acid/*immunology and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Microglia/*immunology and Miniature Postsynaptic Potentials and Multiple Sclerosis/*immunology and Neurons/*immunology and Receptors, AMPA/immunology and Synaptic Transmission/*immunology and Ampa and Eae and amygdala and dendritic spine and microglia and multiple sclerosis",eng,0270-6474 (Print) 0270-6474,9019-9033,38,30185466,"Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta T2N 4N1, Canada.

In contrast, anti-CD52 therapy at disease onset more fully suppresses experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice, and T cell repopulation is rapid. To test whether prolonged T cell lymphopenia promotes relapses, we thymectomized mice prior to EAE induction and anti-CD52 treatment. Thymectomy greatly reduced the number of recent thymic emigrant T cells and was associated with a prolonged reduction in CD4 T cells in peripheral blood.

However, there is a considerable lack of evidence when it comes to an age/developmental stage-dependent efficacy of vitamin D action and a time-window for the most effective prophylactic treatment remains unclear. We studied the effect of vitamin D supplementation in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, at three different developmental stages in rats. Supplementation treatment was initiated: i) prior to gestation and maintained throughout pre- and early postnatal development (gestation and lactation); ii) after weaning, throughout juvenile/adolescence period and iii) in adult age. We observed a marked attenuation of EAE in juvenile/adolescent rats reflected in a less severe CNS inflammation and demyelination, accompanied by a lower amount of IFN-<ce><b3> producing MOG-specific T cells. Moreover, the cytokine expression pattern in these rats reflected a more anti-inflammatory phenotype of their peripheral immune response. However, the same supplementation regimen failed to improve the disease outcome both in adult rats and in rats treated during pre- and early post-natal development.

This study aims to evaluate VD effects on IL-12 and TGF-<ce><b2> expression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). METHODS: EAE was induced in three groups of C57BL/6 mice by immunization with MOG and administered intra-peritoneally 200 ngVD, PBS or olive oil (OO) from day +3 to +30. One group was also considered as healthy control group. At day 31, cytokines expression in the spinal cord and their serum levels were determined using real time-PCR and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: IL-12 gene expression and its serum levels in PBS-injected- or OO-administrated EAE groups were significantly higher than healthy group. IL-12 gene expression in EAE group treated with VD was significantly decreased compared to PBS-injected- or OO-administrated EAE groups (P<0.001 and P<0.02, respectively). Serum IL-12 levels were significantly reduced in VD-treated EAE mice compared to PBS-injected- or OO-administrated EAE groups (P<0.004 and P<0.05, respectively). No significant difference was observed between PBS-injected-EAE, OO-administrated EAE and healthy groups regarding the expression of TGF-<ce><b2>. In EAE mice treated with VD, TGF-<ce><b2> expression was significantly higher than healthy group and PBS-injected EAE mice (P<0.01 and P<0.04, respectively). VD-treated EAE group had also higher serum TGF-<ce><b2> levels than PBS-injected-, OO-administrated and healthy groups (P<0.05).

Here, we investigated whether peripheral immunomodulatory treatment for MS/EAE, glatiramer acetate (GA), can enhance neurogenesis and generate neuroprotection in the CNS of EAE-inflicted mice. EAE was induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide, either in yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) 2.2 transgenic mice, which selectively express YFP on their neuronal population, or in C57BL/6 mice. The in situ effect of GA was studied in various brain regions; neuroprotection and neurogeneration were evaluated and quantified by measuring the expression of different neuronal antigens and in vivo proliferation markers. The results demonstrated that in EAE-inflicted mice, neuroproliferation was initially elevated after disease appearance but subsequently declined below that of naive mice. In contrast, GA treatment in various stages of the disease led to sustained reduction in the neuronal/axonal damage typical to the neurodegenerative disease course. Moreover, three processes characteristic of neurogenesis, namely cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, were augmented and extended by GA treatment in EAE mice compared with EAE-untreated mice and naive controls. The newborn neuroprogenitors manifested massive migration through exciting and dormant migration pathways, into injury sites in brain regions, which do not normally undergo neurogenesis, and differentiated to mature neuronal phenotype. This suggests a direct linkage between immunomodulation, neurogenesis, and an in situ therapeutic consequence in the CNS.",10.1523/jneurosci.1859-05.2005,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.1859-05.2005,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,9,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,NA,"1,2",0.25,6,NA,2,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Aharoni_2005_JN,JOUR,36,"Animals and Bacterial Proteins/analysis/genetics and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/drug therapy/*physiopathology and Genes, Reporter and Glatiramer Acetate and Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use and Luminescent Proteins/analysis/genetics and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Transgenic and Myelin Proteins and Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein/therapeutic use and Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein and Nerve Regeneration/*physiology and Peptides/therapeutic use",eng,0270-6474 (Print) 0270-6474,8217-28,25,16148229,"Department of Immunology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 76100, Israel.",NA,NA,NA,PMC6725544,45176,NLM,1410,"ASReview_relevant and 1529-2401 and Aharoni, Rina and Arnon, Ruth and Eilam, Raya and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2005/09/09 and J Neurosci. 2005 Sep 7;25(36):8217-28. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1859-05.2005.",Neurogenesis and neuroprotection induced by peripheral immunomodulatory treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Marketed,NA,9

Their expression in the CNS after various insults is thus of major therapeutic consequence. Glatiramer acetate [(GA) Copaxone], an approved drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, has been shown to induce Th2/3 cells that accumulate in the CNS, expressing in situ antiinflammatory cytokines and BDNF. In the present study, we investigated whether s.c. injections of GA, applied at various stages of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, affect the expression of NTs, particularly BDNF, in the brain. In untreated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice, the expression of NTs was elevated shortly after disease appearance but subsequently declined below that of naive mice. In contrast, GA treatment led to sustained augmentation in the expression of BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4 in various brain regions as demonstrated by histological analysis of immunostained brain sections. GA treatment, even when started 45 days after disease induction, restored the impaired level of NTs to that of healthy mice. BDNF elevation after GA treatment was demonstrated on both protein and mRNA levels. Prominent staining was manifested not only by infiltrating GA-induced T cells, but also by CNS resident cells (neurons and astrocytes), indicative of a bystander therapeutic effect. Of importance, in GA-treated mice, intense BDNF expression was manifested by neuronal progenitors that migrated into lesions in injured regions. These results indicate that the immunomodulator GA exerts not only an antiinflammatory effect, but also enhances neuroprotection and regeneration of neural elements in the diseased brain.",10.1073/pnas.0509438102,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0509438102,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,"C57BL/6, (SJLxBALB/c)F1",female,10,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,NA,"1,2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"two strains listed, since no clinical scores or MRI data included (for other papers only the strain listed which was used for clinical score / MRI data presented here)",Aharoni_2005_PNASUSA,JOUR,52,"Animals and Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology and Astrocytes/cytology and Brain/*metabolism/pathology and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism and Cell Survival and Central Nervous System/metabolism and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*immunology and Female and Glatiramer Acetate and Immunohistochemistry and Immunosuppressive Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology and In Situ Hybridization and Mice and Mice, Inbred BALB C and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Myelin Proteins and Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein/chemistry and Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein and Nerve Growth Factors/*metabolism and Neurons/cytology/metabolism and Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology and Neurotrophin 3/metabolism and Peptides/*pharmacology and Polymers/chemistry and Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction and Stem Cells/metabolism and T-Lymphocytes/cytology and Time Factors",eng,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424,19045-50,102,16365293,"Departments of Immunology and Veterinary Resources, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.",NA,NA,NA,PMC1323190,45287,NLM,1398,"ASReview_relevant and 1091-6490 and Aharoni, Rina and Eilam, Raya and Domev, Hagit and Labunskay, Galya and Sela, Michael and Arnon, Ruth and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2005/12/21 and Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Dec 27;102(52):19045-50. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0509438102.

Elevation of interstitial glutamate concentrations measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) implies that glutamate excess plays a role in the damage processes inflicted by this disease.

Copolymer 1 (Cop 1, Copaxone, glatiramer acetate), an approved drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, is a potent inducer of Th2 regulatory cells in both mice and humans. Highly reactive Cop 1-specific T cell lines that secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and transforming growth factor-beta in response to Cop 1 and crossreact with myelin basic protein (MBP) at the level of Th2 cytokine secretion were established from both brains and spinal cords of Cop 1-treated mice. In contrast, no reactivity to the control antigen lysozyme could be obtained in lymphocytes isolated from CNS of mice injected with lysozyme. Adoptively transferred labeled Cop 1-specific suppressor cells were found in brain sections 7 and 10 days after their injection to the periphery, whereas lysozyme-specific cells were absent in the CNS. Hence, Cop 1-induced Th2 cells cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the CNS, where they can be stimulated in situ by MBP and thereby exert therapeutic effects in the diseased organ. This therapeutic effect was manifested, in brains of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis-induced mice, by a decrease in the inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma and by secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in response to the autoantigen MBP.",10.1073/pnas.97.21.11472,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.97.21.11472,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,(SJLxBALB/c)F1,female,12,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Aharoni_2000_PNASUSA,JOUR,21,"Adjuvants, Immunologic/*administration & dosage and Adoptive Transfer and Animals and Central Nervous System/metabolism/*pathology and Cytokines/metabolism and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*prevention & control and Female and Fluorescent Dyes and Glatiramer Acetate and Mice and Mice, Inbred BALB C and Muramidase/administration & dosage and Peptides/*immunology and Th2 Cells/*cytology",eng,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424,11472-7,97,11027347,"Departments of Immunology and Biological Services, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.",NA,NA,NA,PMC17224,45209,NLM,1615,"ASReview_relevant and 1091-6490 and Aharoni, R and Teitelbaum, D and Leitner, O and Meshorer, A and Sela, M and Arnon, R and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2000/10/12 and Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Oct 10;97(21):11472-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.97.21.11472.",Specific Th2 cells accumulate in the central nervous system of mice protected against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by copolymer 1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Marketed,NA,18

Novel treatment strategies aim to operate within the CNS to induce neuroprotection and repair processes in addition to their anti-inflammatory properties. In this study we analyzed and compared the in situ pathological manifestations of EAE utilizing two different models, namely the relapsing-remitting PLP-induced and the chronic MOG-induced diseases. To characterize pathological changes, both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunohistochemistry were employed. The effect of the approved MS drug glatiramer acetate (GA, Copaxone) on myelin damage/repair and on motor neuron loss/preservation was studied in both EAE models. Ultrastructural spinal cord analysis revealed multiple white matter damage foci, with different patterns in the two EAE models. Thus, the relapsing-remitting model was characterized mainly by widespread myelin damage and by remyelinating fibers, whereas in the chronic model axonal degeneration was more prevalent. Loss of lower motor neurons was manifested only in mice with chronic MOG-induced disease. In the GA-treated mice, smaller lesions, increased axonal density and higher prevalence of normal appearing axons were observed, as well as decreased demyelination and degeneration. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of the relative remyelination versus demyelination, provides for the first time evidence of significant augmentation of remyelination after GA treatment. The loss of motor neurons in GA-treated mice was also reduced in comparison to that of EAE untreated mice. These effects were obtained even when GA treatment was applied in a therapeutic schedule, namely after the appearance of clinical symptoms. Hence, the remyelination and neuronal preservation induced by GA are in support of the neuroprotective consequences of this treatment.",10.1016/j.jaut.2011.06.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2011.06.003,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,(SJLxBALB/c)F1,female,10,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,NA,"1,2",0,NA,NA,3.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"C57BL/6 mice for chronic EAE model, (SJL/JxBALB/c)F1 mice for relapsing-remitting EAE model. very small number of animals used?

C. and Rinne, J.",2015,J Nucl Med,In vivo PET imaging demonstrates diminished microglial activation after fingolimod treatment in an animal model of multiple sclerosis,"There is a great need for the monitoring of microglial activation surrounding multiple sclerosis lesions because the activation of microglia is thought to drive widespread neuronal damage. Recently, second-generation PET radioligands that can reveal the extent of microglial activation by quantifying the increased expression of the 18-kDa translocator protein have been developed. Here, we investigate whether PET imaging can be used to demonstrate the reduction in microglial activation surrounding a chronic focal multiple sclerosis (MS)-like lesion after treatment with fingolimod, an established MS therapy. METHODS: Chronic focal experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE)-like lesions were induced in Lewis rats (n = 24) via stereotactic intrastriatal injection of heat-killed bacillus Calmette-Gu<c3><a9>rin (BCG) and subsequent activation using an intradermal injection of BCG in complete Freund adjuvant. This process resulted in a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)-like EAE lesion. The extent of neuroinflammation surrounding the lesion was measured using (18)F-GE180 as a PET radioligand. The imaging was performed before and after treatment with fingolimod (0.3 mg/kg/d by mouth, 28 d) or vehicle as a control. In addition to imaging, autoradiography and immunohistochemistry experiments were performed to verify the in vivo results. RESULTS: The chronic DTH EAE lesion led to increased ligand binding in the ipsilateral, compared with contralateral, hemisphere when PET imaging was performed with the translocator protein-binding radioligand (18)F-GE180. Treatment with fingolimod led to a highly significant reduction in the binding potential, which could be demonstrated using both in vivo and ex vivo imaging (fingolimod vs. vehicle treatment, P < 0.0001). The area of increased (18)F-GE180 signal mapped closely to the area of activated microglial cells detected by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: PET imaging, unlike MR imaging, can be used to visualize the microglial activation surrounding a chronic DTH EAE lesion. Importantly, the treatment effect of fingolimod can be monitored in vivo by measuring the degree of microglial activation surrounding the chronic DTH EAE lesion.

We show that the major green tea constituent, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), dramatically suppresses EAE induced by proteolipid protein 139-151. EGCG reduced clinical severity when given at initiation or after the onset of EAE by both limiting brain inflammation and reducing neuronal damage. In orally treated mice, we found abrogated proliferation and TNF-alpha production of encephalitogenic T cells. In human myelin-specific CD4+ T cells, cell cycle arrest was induced, down-regulating the cyclin-dependent kinase 4. Interference with both T cell growth and effector function was mediated by blockade of the catalytic activities of the 20S/26S proteasome complex, resulting in intracellular accumulation of IkappaB-alpha and subsequent inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. Because its structure implicates additional antioxidative properties, EGCG was capable of protecting against neuronal injury in living brain tissue induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate or TRAIL and of directly blocking the formation of neurotoxic reactive oxygen species in neurons. Thus, a natural green tea constituent may open up a new therapeutic avenue for young disabled adults with inflammatory brain disease by combining, on one hand, anti-inflammatory and, on the other hand, neuroprotective capacities.",10.4049/jimmunol.173.9.5794,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.173.9.5794,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SJL,female,7,Epigallocatechin gallate,control,1,NA,"1,2",0.7,9,0.25,2,9,0.4,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Aktas_2004_JI,JOUR,9,"Administration, Oral and Animals and Catechin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology and Cell Death/drug effects and Cell Line and Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 and Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors and Down-Regulation/drug effects and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/pathology/physiopathology/*prevention and & control and Female and Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology and Humans and I-kappa B Proteins/biosynthesis and Immunity, Cellular/drug effects and Jurkat Cells and Mice and NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha and NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism and Neurons/cytology/drug effects/metabolism and Neuroprotective Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use and Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors and Reactive Oxygen Species/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism and T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/*metabolism and *Tea and Up-Regulation/drug effects",eng,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767,5794-800,173,15494532,"Institute of Neuroimmunology, Neuroscience Research Center, CharitÃ©, Berlin, Germany.",NA,NA,NA,NA,45231,NLM,1441,"ASReview_relevant and Aktas, Orhan and Prozorovski, Timour and Smorodchenko, Alina and Savaskan, Nicolai E and Lauster, Roland and Kloetzel, Peter-Michael and Infante-Duarte, Carmen and Brocke, Stefan and Zipp, Frauke and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2004/10/21 and J Immunol. 2004 Nov 1;173(9):5794-800. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.173.9.5794.",Green tea epigallocatechin-3-gallate mediates T cellular NF-kappa B inhibition and exerts neuroprotection in autoimmune encephalomyelitis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,22

Here we demonstrate that both subcutaneous and oral administration of atorvastatin inhibit the development of actively induced chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in SJL/J mice and significantly reduce the inflammatory infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS). When treatment was started after disease onset, atorvastatin reduced the incidence of relapses and protected from the development of further disability. Both the reduced autoreactive T cell response measured by proliferation toward the encephalitogenic peptide PLP139-151 and the cytokine profile indicate a potent blockade of T helper cell type 1 immune response. In in vitro assays atorvastatin not only inhibited antigen-specific responses, but also decreased T cell proliferation mediated by direct TCR engagement independently of MHC class II and LFA-1. Inhibition of proliferation was not due to apoptosis induction, but linked to a negative regulation on cell cycle progression. However, early T cell activation was unaffected, as reflected by unaltered calcium fluxes.

METHODS: Using bioinformatics analysis of publicly available transcriptomics data, we determined the accumulation of B cells, plasma cells and T cells in different compartments of multiple sclerosis patients (MS) and healthy individual brains. Based on these observations and on the literature search, we dosed RTX in EAE mice either orally, or injected intraperitoneally (IP). The latter route was used either prophylactically (asymptomatic stage; upon the induction of the disease), or therapeutically (acute stage; upon the appearance of the first sign of the disease). Further, we used RTX as a preventive drug either as a single agent or in combination with other routes of administration. RESULTS: Because no complete recovery was observed when RTX was used prophylactically or therapeutically, we devised another protocol of injecting this drug before the onset of the disease and designated this regiment as prevention. We demonstrated that the 20 <ce><bc>g/mouse prevention completely reduced the EAE clinical score, impaired infiltration of T and B cells into the perivascular space of mice brains, along with inhibiting the inflammation and demyelination. However, the 5 and 10 <ce><bc>g/mouse doses although reduced all aspects of inflammation in these mice, their effects were not as potent as the 20 <ce><bc>g/mouse RTX dose. Finally, we combined the 5 <ce><bc>g/mouse prevention treatment with either the prophylactic or therapeutic regimen and observed a robust effect. CONCLUSION: We observed that combinatorial regimens resulted in further reduction of inflammation, T and B cell extravasation into the brains of EAE mice and improved the re-myelination.",10.2147/jir.S243514,https://doi.org/10.2147/jir.S243514,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SJL,female,5,Rituximab,control,1,NA,"0,1,2,3",1.6,5,0.5,3.25,5,0.6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"rituximab --> no significant diff in therapeutic use (significant diff. for some other treatment regimes). also compared to monomethyl fumarate (significant improvement, also on our list of drugs) --> therefore listed as second drug, see columns BK etc (also added ""control 2"").",Al.Ani_2020_JIR,JOUR,NA,B cells and T cells and bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry and in silico and inflammation and prevention and prophylactic and rituximab and therapeutic,eng,1178-7031 (Print) 1178-7031,151-164,13,32214838,"Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Sharjah, Sharjah, 27272, United Arabs Emirates.

J. and Giovannoni, G. and Baker, D.",2011,Mult Scler,Immunosuppression with FTY720 is insufficient to prevent secondary progressive neurodegeneration in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,"BACKGROUND: There has been poor translation for the use of immunosuppressive agents from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), into the treatment of MS. This may be due to the fact that most EAE studies examine prophylactic, pre-treatment regimes that prove to be therapeutically-ineffective in long-established, often progressive, MS. FTY720 (fingolimod/Gilenya) is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator. This is a new oral agent that markedly reduces the number of relapses in people with MS, compared with currently licensed injectable agents such as the beta interferons. FTY720 has activity against lymphocytes but may also influence oligodendroglia and could therefore have the potential to influence progressive MS, by promoting remyelination. METHODS: The effect of FTY720 was assessed in relapsing-progressive EAE in mice. RESULTS: Early intervention during relapsing EAE could completely inhibit subsequent relapses, inhibited the accumulation of neurodegeneration, and facilitated motor recovery. However, when examined in secondary progressive EAE, that develops after the accumulation of deficit from relapsing disease, long-term treatment with FTY720 failed to slow deterioration when initiated late (4 months) into the disease course. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that early intervention with immunosuppressive agents may inhibit the generation of the neurodegenerative microenvironment, which is no longer responsive to potent immunosuppression. However, if treatment is initiated too late, progressive, neurological-disease continues unabated. This suggests that immunosuppression is insufficient to control secondary progression in animals, as has been found so far to be the case in MS, and may warrant early intervention with FTY720 for optimal treatment benefit.",10.1177/1352458511400476,https://doi.org/10.1177/1352458511400476,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,Biozzi ABH,both,7,Fingolimod,control,1,NA,"1,2",1.25,9,0.1,3.25,9,0.35,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Al.Izki_2011_MultScle,JOUR,8,"Animals and Disease Progression and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology and Female and Fingolimod Hydrochloride and Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use and Male and Mice and Nerve Degeneration/*drug therapy and Propylene Glycols/*therapeutic use and Recovery of Function/drug effects and Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use",eng,1352-4585,939-48,17,21459808,"Centre of Neuroscience and Trauma, Blizard Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, UK. s.al-izki@qmul.ac.uk",NA,NA,NA,NA,Aug,NLM,1069,"ASReview_relevant and 1477-0970 and Al-Izki, Sarah and Pryce, Gareth and Jackson, Samuel J and Giovannoni, Gavin and Baker, David and 835/MSS_/Multiple Sclerosis Society/United Kingdom and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and England and 2011/04/05 and Mult Scler. 2011 Aug;17(8):939-48. doi: 10.1177/1352458511400476.

The current study aimed to investigate the possible therapeutic effects of combining vitamin D3 (Vit D3) and siponimod (Sipo) on enhancing remyelination and modulating microglia phenotypes in the cuprizone (CPZ) demyelination mouse model. The study was divided into two stages; demyelination (first 5 weeks) and remyelination (last 4 weeks). In the first 5 weeks, 85 mice were randomly divided into two groups, control (n = 20, standard rodent chow) and CPZ (n = 65, 0.3% CPZ mixed with chow for 6 weeks, followed by 3 weeks of standard rodent chow). At week 5, the CPZ group was re-divided into four groups (n = 14) for remyelination stages; untreated CPZ (0.2 ml of CMC orally), CPZ+Vit D3 (800 IU/kg Vit D3 orally), CPZ+Sipo (1.5 mg/kg Sipo orally), and CPZ+Vit D3 (800 IU/kg Vit D3) + Sipo (1.5 mg/kg Sipo orally). Various behavioral tasks were performed to evaluate motor performance. Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining, the expression level of myelin basic protein (MBP), and M1/M2 microglia phenotype genes were assessed in the corpus callosum (CC). The results showed that the combination of Vit D3 and Sipo improved behavioral deficits, significantly promoted remyelination, and modulated expression levels of microglia phenotype genes in the CC at early and late remyelination stages. These results demonstrate for the first time that a combination of Vit D3 and Sipo can improve the remyelination process in the cuprizone (CPZ) mouse model by attenuating the M1 microglia phenotype.

Here, we compared the effect of anti-CD20 therapy on microglial activation in two distinct focal rat models of MS. METHODS: The effect of anti-CD20 therapy on lesion formation and extralesional microglial activation was evaluated in the fDTH-EAE (experimental allergic encephalomyelitis) model, which is a focal demyelinating type-IV delayed-type hypersensitivity lesion. For comparison, effects were also assessed in the focal humoral MOG model induced by intracerebral injection of cytokine in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein immunized rats. Microglial activation was assessed in situ and in vivo using the TSPO SPECT ligand [(125)I]DPA-713, and by immunostaining for MHCII. The effect of treatment on demyelination and lymphocyte recruitment to the brain were evaluated. RESULTS: Anti-CD20 therapy reduced microglial activation, and lesion formation in the humoral model, but it was most effective in the antibody-independent fDTH-EAE. Immunohistochemistry for MHCII also demonstrated a reduced volume of microglial activation in the brains of anti-CD20-treated fDTH-EAE animals, which was accompanied by a reduction in T-cell recruitment and demyelination. The effect anti-CD20 therapy in the latter model was similarly strong as compared to the T-cell targeting MS compound FTY720. INTERPRETATION: The suppression of lesion development by anti-CD20 treatment in an antibody-independent model suggests that B-cells play an important role in lesion development, independent of auto-antibody production. Thus, CD20-positive B-cell depletion has the potential to be effective in a wider population of individuals with MS than might have been predicted from our knowledge of the underlying histopathology.",10.1002/acn3.94,https://doi.org/10.1002/acn3.94,IEB,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,male,NA,Rituximab,control,1,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"animals ""at least 3 weeks old"". two different EAE models used: fMOG-EAE and fDTH-EAE.",Anthony_2014_AnnCliTraNeu,JOUR,9,NA,eng,2328-9503 (Print) 2328-9503,659-69,1,25493280,"Department of Pharmacology, University of Oxford Mansfield Road, Oxford, OX1 3QT, United Kingdom.

The fusion protein CTLA4Ig can block this interaction and prevent specific T cell activation. The development of fatal CD4+ T cell-mediated experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in susceptible female Lewis rats was optimized by immunization with 20 mg of guinea pig spinal cord homogenate in CFA on day 0 with three doses of 1 microgram pertussis toxin given i.v. on days 0, 3, and 7. This immunization regimen uniformly resulted in the development of severe clinical neurologic signs of EAE with 100% mortality by day 17 postimmunization. Treatment with 0.5 mg/dose of rhCTLA4-Ig on days - 2, 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 significantly decreased the incidence, delayed the onset, and reduced the severity of clinical EAE (p = 0.0002 vs control by the Mann-Whitney U test) enough to completely prevent fatal EAE, whereas treatment with control human IgG had no effect. Histologically, perivascular neutrophilic infiltrates were also dramatically decreased in the spinal cords of animals treated with CTLA4 but not in those treated with control human IgG. The proliferative response to encephalitogenic Ags (guinea pig myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein) by lymph node cells from animals immunized with guinea pig spinal cord 10 days before was also significantly suppressed in vitro by CTLA4Ig (1 microg/ml). However, the protective effect of CTLA4Ig could be completely prevented by the daily i.p. administration, from day 0 to 10, of exogenous human rIL-2 (180,000 IU). These results indicate a critical requirement of the costimulatory B7/CD28 pathway early in the development of CD4+ T cell-mediated EAE in the rat.",NA,https://doi.org/,IEB,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,female,8.5,Abatacept,control,1,53,"0,1",7,5,NA,5.5,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.156.12.4916 ; figure 4 --> clinicalnscore of drug worse than control, (only pre-induction has positive outcome).",Arima_1996_JI,JOUR,12,"Abatacept and Animals and Antigens, CD and Antigens, Differentiation/*immunology and CTLA-4 Antigen and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*immunology/pathology and Female and *Immunoconjugates and Immunosuppression Therapy and Interleukin-2/administration & dosage and Lymphocyte Activation and Rats and Rats, Inbred Lew and Signal Transduction and Spinal Cord/immunology and T-Lymphocytes/*immunology and Time Factors",eng,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767,4916-24,156,8648142,"Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,45092,NLM,1769,"ASReview_relevant and Arima, T and Rehman, A and Hickey, W F and Flye, M W and 1 P01 AI 35121/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and United States and 1996/06/15 and J Immunol. 1996 Jun 15;156(12):4916-24.",Inhibition by CTLA4Ig of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,30

OBJECTIVE: The present study was carried out to examine whether Betaferon suppresses progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The EAE model was employed in guinea pigs in vivo, and mononuclear cell proliferation and 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity were assessed in vitro. RESULTS: Betaferon was more reactive in two assays of guinea pigs, mitogen-induced proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity of blood, than in rats and rabbits. Guinea pigs were immunized actively by antigen, porcine myelin basic protein. The neurological deficits were assessed by clinical signs scored daily. Guinea pig Betaferon, replaced with guinea pig albumin (GPA), at 1.2 and 12.0 MIU/kg/day or vehicle was administered subcutaneously daily for 20 days in the immunized guinea pigs. GPA-Betaferon suppressed the manifestation of ataxia or more progression of chronic neurological deficits significantly at 1.2 MIU/kg (p <0.05). Two out of 10 animals manifested no clinical signs in the GPA-Betaferon-treated group with the higher dose, while all animals were worsened with typical clinical signs of EAE in the vehicle group where mononuclear cell infiltrates around blood vessels were seen in the spinal cord of vehicle-treated animals.

There is also supporting evidence on the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in the neuro-protective action. However, its over production could contribute to brain disorders. In this study, demyelination was induced by ethidium bromide (EB) injection into the right side of the hippocampus area of male rats. Vitamin D3 was administered to rats for 7 and 28 days prior to behavioral experiments using Morris water maze (MWM). Travelled distance, time spent to reach the platform, and time spent in target zone, were considered for learning and spatial memory evaluation. Nitrite oxide (NO2-) concentration was measured as an indicator for nitric oxide production. The time spent to reach the platform and the travelled distance were decreased significantly by 28 days of vitamin D3 administration (compared to 7 days experiment). Time spent in target quadrant was significantly lowered by administered vitamin on day 28. Therefore, considering a number of studies that have shown the effect of vitamin D3 on cognition, these findings could support their potential effect. Besides, nitric oxide concentration significantly differed in 28 days of vitamin D3 treated group compared with the groups treated with EB or 7 days of vitamin D3..",10.1590/s2175-97902022e20245,https://doi.org/10.1590/s2175-97902022e20245,IEB,1,NA,ethidium bromide,rat,Wistar,male,9,Vitamin D3,control,1,50,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ataie_2022_BrJoofPhSc,JOUR,NA,colecalciferol and nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase and nitrite and sesame seed oil and animal experiment and animal model and animal tissue and article and controlled study and demyelination and drug mechanism and escape latency and hippocampus and learning and male and Morris water maze test and motor coordination and neuroprotection and nonhuman and rat and spatial memory and spectrophotometry and swimming speed and total distance traveled,English,2175-9790 1984-8250,NA,58,NA,"M.

However, this treatment is not always effective. Here we have found congruence in outcome between responses to IFN-beta in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). IFN-beta was effective in reducing EAE symptoms induced by T helper type 1 (T(H)1) cells but exacerbated disease induced by T(H)17 cells. Effective treatment in T(H)1-induced EAE correlated with increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) production by splenocytes. In T(H)17-induced disease, the amount of IL-10 was unaltered by treatment, although, unexpectedly, IFN-beta treatment still reduced IL-17 production without benefit. Both inhibition of IL-17 and induction of IL-10 depended on IFN-gamma. In the absence of IFN-gamma signaling, IFN-beta therapy was ineffective in EAE. In RRMS patients, IFN-beta nonresponders had higher IL-17F concentrations in serum compared to responders. Nonresponders had worse disease with more steroid usage and more relapses than did responders. Hence, IFN-beta is proinflammatory in T(H)17-induced EAE.

Alterations in the TJ proteins are common in inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) like multiple sclerosis (MS). Modulation of the BBB could thus represent a therapeutic mechanism. One pathway to modulate BBB integrity could be the induction of nuclear-factor (erythroid derived 2) related factor-2 (Nrf2) mediated oxidative stress responses which are targeted by fumaric acid esters (FAE). Here we analyze effects of FAE on the expression of TJ proteins in the human cerebral endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We show that dimethylfumarate (DMF) and its primary metabolite monomethylfumarate (MMF) induce the expression of the Nrf2/NQO1 pathway in endothelial cells. Neither MMF nor DMF had a consistent modulatory effect on the expression of TJ molecules in hCMEC/D3 cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF<ce><b1>)-induced downregulation of TJ proteins was at least partially reversed by treatment with FAE. However, DMF had no effect on claudin-5 expression in EAE, despite its effect on the clinical score and infiltration of immune cells.

We found that treatment with 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), a broad-spectrum K(+) channel antagonist, results in: (1) decreased number of oligodendroglial progenitors (OP) and OLGs; (2) diminished astrogliosis; and (3) decreased remyelination in the corpus callosum based on the immunoreactivity to myelin basic protein (MBP), Rip monoclonal antibody, and by electron microscopy. Our findings support the concept that glial K(+) channels play an important role during OLG regeneration and remyelination, a crucial factor to be considered during the development of therapeutic strategies to facilitate recovery in demyelinating diseases and spinal cord injury.",10.1002/glia.20067,https://doi.org/10.1002/glia.20067,IEB,1,NA,cuprizone,mouse,C57BL/6,male,8,Fampridine,control,3,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,outcome negative or mixed?,Bacia_2004_Glia,JOUR,2,"4-Aminopyridine/pharmacology and Animals and Astrocytes/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure and Chelating Agents and Corpus Callosum/drug effects/metabolism/pathology and Cuprizone and Demyelinating Diseases/chemically induced/*metabolism/physiopathology and Disease Models, Animal and Gliosis/chemically induced/metabolism/physiopathology and Male and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Microscopy, Electron, Transmission and Myelin Basic Protein/drug effects/metabolism and Myelin Sheath/*metabolism/pathology/ultrastructure and Nerve Regeneration/drug effects/*physiology and Neuroglia/drug effects/*metabolism and Oligodendroglia/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure and Potassium Channel Blockers/pharmacology and Potassium Channels/drug effects/*metabolism and Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure",eng,0894-1491 (Print) 0894-1491,156-65,48,15378653,"Department of Neurology and Committee on Neurobiology, Brain Research Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,45231,NLM,1449,"ASReview_relevant and Bacia, Andrzej and Wollmann, Robert and Soliven, Betty and R01 NS039346/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and R01-NS-39346/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and United States and 2004/09/21 and Glia. 2004 Nov 1;48(2):156-65. doi: 10.1002/glia.20067.",K+ channel blockade impairs remyelination in the cuprizone model,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Marketed,NA,35

Here, we used this model to study the impact of the S1P(1) receptor modulator FTY720 (fingolimod) on the autoreactive B cell and antibody response both in the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS). METHODS: MP4-immunized mice were treated orally with FTY720 for 30<c2><a0>days at the peak of disease or 50<c2><a0>days after EAE onset. The subsequent disease course was monitored and the MP4-specific B cell/antibody response was measured by ELISPOT and ELISA. RNA sequencing was performed to determine any effects on B cell-relevant gene expression. S1P(1) receptor expression by peripheral T and B cells, B cell subset distribution in the spleen and B cell infiltration into the CNS were studied by flow cytometry. The formation of B cell aggregates and of tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) was evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry. Potential direct effects of FTY720 on B cell aggregation were studied in vitro. RESULTS: FTY720 significantly attenuated clinical EAE when treatment was initiated at the peak of EAE. While there was a significant reduction in the number of T cells in the blood after FTY720 treatment, B cells were only slightly diminished. Yet, there was evidence for the modulation of B cell receptor-mediated signaling upon FTY720 treatment. In addition, we detected a significant increase in the percentage of B220(+) B cells in the spleen both in acute and chronic EAE. Whereas acute treatment completely abrogated B cell aggregate formation in the CNS, the numbers of infiltrating B cells and plasma cells were comparable between vehicle- and FTY720-treated mice. In addition, there was no effect on already developed aggregates in chronic EAE. In vitro B cell aggregation assays suggested the absence of a direct effect of FTY720 on B cell aggregation. However, FTY720 impacted the evolution of B cell aggregates into TLOs. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest differential effects of FTY720 on the B cell compartment in MP4-induced EAE.",10.1186/s12974-017-0924-4,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-017-0924-4,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,6,Fingolimod,control,1,NA,2,1.2,14,0.25,2.25,9,0.15,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Bail_2017_JN,JOUR,1,"Animals and Antigens, CD19/metabolism and B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism and CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/pathology and Calcium-Binding Proteins/metabolism and Cell Aggregation/drug effects and Central Nervous System/pathology and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/blood/chemically induced/*drug and therapy/*pathology and Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay and Female and Fingolimod Hydrochloride/*therapeutic use and Flow Cytometry and Freund's Adjuvant/toxicity and Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use and Lymph Nodes/pathology and Mice and Myelin Basic Protein/immunology/toxicity and Myelin Proteolipid Protein/immunology/toxicity and Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology/toxicity and Spleen/pathology and Time Factors and B cells and Eae and Fty720 and Fingolimod and Multiple sclerosis and Tlo",eng,1742-2094,148,14,28738885,"Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of WÃ¼rzburg, WÃ¼rzburg, Germany.

To elucidate its effects in the central nervous system (CNS), we compared functional parameters of nerve conductance in the DA rat model of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) after preventive and therapeutic treatment. We demonstrate that prophylactic therapy protected against the emergence of EAE symptoms, neuropathology, and disturbances to visual and somatosensory evoked potentials (VEP, SEP). Moreover, therapeutic treatment from day 25 to 45 markedly reversed paralysis in established EAE and normalized the electrophysiological responses, correlating with decreased demyelination in the brain and spinal cord. The effectiveness of FTY720 in this model is likely due to several contributing factors. Evidence thus far supports its role in the reduction of inflammation and preservation of blood-brain-barrier integrity.

Blocking adhesion molecules or preventing the effects of chemotactic mediators such as chemokines can be exploited to prevent immune cell recruitment to inflamed tissues. An anti-<ce><b1>4 integrin antibody (anti-VLA-4mAb/natalizumab (Tysabri<c2><ae>)) has been used as a treatment for MS and reduces leukocyte influx into the brain. In patients, anti-VLA-4 reduces relapses and disability progression. However, its mechanism of action in the brain is not completely understood. The anti-VLA-4mAb was demonstrated to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells. Interestingly, the chemokine SDF-1/CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 are also key factors regulating the migration of hematopoietic stem cells. Moreover, studies have revealed a crosstalk between SDF-1/CXCR4 and VLA-4 signaling in regulating cell migration. In this study, we address the effects of anti-VLA-4 on chemokine signaling in the brain during MS. We assessed the ability of anti-VLA-4 to regulate Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) and chemokine/receptor signaling. Preclinical administration of anti-VLA-4 delayed clinical signs of EAE. We found that anti-VLA-4 treatment reduced chemokine expression. In order to further explore the interaction of anti-VLA-4 with chemokine/receptor signaling we used dual color transgenic mice. After EAE induction, the expression of both SDF-1/CXCL12 and CXCR4 receptor was upregulated, treatment with anti-VLA-4 inhibited this effect.

Here, we variously assessed the effects of an azide analogue of (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate (compound 5; a sphingosine kinase 1 activator), (R)-FTY720 methyl ether (ROMe, a sphingosine kinase 2 inhibitor) and RB-020 (a sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitor and sphingosine kinase 2 substrate) on IL-1<ce><b2> formation, sphingosine 1-phosphate levels and expression of S1P(1) receptors. We also assessed the effect of compound 5 and ROMe in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We measured IL-1<ce><b2> formation by macrophages, sphingosine 1-phosphate levels and expression levels of S1P(1) receptors in vitro and clinical score in mice with EAE and the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration into the spinal cord in vivo. KEY RESULTS: Treatment of differentiated U937 macrophages with compound 5, RB-020 or sphingosine (but not ROMe) enhanced IL-1<ce><b2> release. These data suggest that these compounds might be pro-inflammatory in vitro. However, compound 5 or ROMe reduced disease progression and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the spinal cord in EAE, and ROMe induced a reduction in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell levels in the blood (lymphopenia). Indeed, ROMe induced a marked decrease in expression of cell surface S1P(1) receptors in vitro. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This is the first demonstration that an activator of sphingosine kinase 1 (compound 5) and an inhibitor of sphingosine kinase 2 (ROMe, which also reduces cell surface S1P(1) receptor expression) have an anti-inflammatory action in EAE.",10.1111/bph.13670,https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.13670,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,9.5,Fingolimod,control,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Barbour_2017_BJP,JOUR,2,"Animals and Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/chemistry/*pharmacology and Cells, Cultured and Cricetulus and Dose-Response Relationship, Drug and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism and Humans and Interleukin-1beta/*metabolism and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism and Piperidines/chemistry/*pharmacology and Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/*biosynthesis and Sphingosine/chemistry/*pharmacology and Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors and Structure-Activity Relationship",eng,0007-1188 (Print) 0007-1188,210-222,174,27864936,"Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Science, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK.",NA,NA,NA,PMC5192795,Jan,NLM,577,"ASReview_relevant and 1476-5381 and Barbour, Mark and McNaughton, Melissa and Boomkamp, Stephanie D and MacRitchie, Neil and Jiang, Hui-Rong and Pyne, Nigel J and Pyne, Susan and Journal Article and England and 2016/11/20 and Br J Pharmacol. 2017 Jan;174(2):210-222. doi: 10.1111/bph.13670.

However, very little is known about its effect on innate immune cells. In this study, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice were administered murine anti-CD52-Ab to investigate its effect on dendritic cells and monocytes/macrophages in the periphery lymphoid organs and the central nervous system (CNS). Our data show that blood and splenic innate immune cells exhibited significantly increased expression of MHC-II and costimulatory molecules, which was associated with increased capacity of activating antigen-specific T cells, at first day but not three weeks after five daily treatment with anti-CD52-Ab in comparison with controls. In contrast to the periphery, microglia and infiltrating macrophages in the CNS exhibited reduced expression levels of MHC-II and costimulatory molecules after antibody treatment at both time-points investigated when compared to controls. Furthermore, the transit response of peripheral innate immune cells to anti-CD52-Ab treatment was also observed in the lymphocyte-deficient SCID mice, suggesting the changes are not a direct consequence of the mass depletion of lymphocytes in the periphery. Our study demonstrates a dynamic and tissue-specific modulation of the innate immune cells in their phenotype and function following the antibody treatment. The findings of differential modulation of the microglia and infiltrating macrophages in the CNS in comparison with the innate immune cells in the peripheral organs support the CNS-specific beneficial effect of alemtuzumab treatment on inhibiting neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis patients.",10.1111/imm.13437,https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.13437,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,9.5,Alemtuzumab,control,1,NA,2,0.8,10,0.25,3.2,10,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Anti-mouse CD52 monoclonal antibodies --> in drug name synonyms this antibody is listed as a synonym for alemtuzumab, however without ""murine""",Barbour_2022_Immu,JOUR,3,"Alemtuzumab/pharmacology and Animals and Antibodies and CD52 Antigen/metabolism and Central Nervous System/metabolism and *Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental and Humans and Immunity, Innate and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, SCID and Eae and anti-CD52 antibody and innate immune cells",eng,0019-2805 (Print) 0019-2805,312-327,165,34826154,"Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK.",NA,NA,NA,PMC9426620,Mar,NLM,110,"ASReview_relevant and 1365-2567 and Barbour, Mark and Orcid: 0000-0003-1547-1289 and Wood, Rachel and Harte, Tanith and Bushell, Trevor J and Jiang, Hui-Rong and Orcid: 0000-0002-5753-0091 and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and England and 2021/11/27 and Immunology. 2022 Mar;165(3):312-327. doi: 10.1111/imm.13437.

Pathogenesis may be antibody independent, as B cell depletion therapy (BCDT) leads to amelioration of disease irrespective of autoantibody ablation. However, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. We demonstrate that BCDT alleviates central nervous system autoimmunity through ablation of IL-6-secreting pathogenic B cells. B cells from mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) secreted elevated levels of IL-6 compared with B cells from naive controls, and mice with a B cell-specific IL-6 deficiency showed less severe disease than mice with wild-type B cells. Moreover, BCDT ameliorated EAE only in mice with IL-6-sufficient B cells. This mechanism of pathogenesis may also operate in multiple sclerosis (MS) because B cells from MS patients produced more IL-6 than B cells from healthy controls, and this abnormality was normalized with B cell reconstitution after Rituximab treatment. This suggests that BCDT improved disease progression, at least partly, by eliminating IL-6-producing B cells in MS patients. Taking these data together, we conclude that IL-6 secretion is a major mechanism of B cell-driven pathogenesis in T cell-mediated autoimmune disease such as EAE and MS.",10.1084/jem.20111675,https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20111675,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,NA,NA,7,Rituximab,control,1,NA,2,2.8,NA,0.35,4.2,NA,0.5,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Barr_2012_JEM,JOUR,5,"Adoptive Transfer and Analysis of Variance and Animals and Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/pharmacology and B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism and DNA Primers/genetics and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*immunology/physiopathology/*therapy and Flow Cytometry and Humans and Interleukin-6/deficiency/*metabolism and Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods and Mice and Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/*immunology/*therapy and Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction and Rituximab and Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms and Statistics, Nonparametric",eng,0022-1007 (Print) 0022-1007,1001-10,209,22547654,"Institute of Immunology and Infection Research, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. tom.barr@ed.ac.uk",NA,NA,NA,PMC3348102,45053,NLM,985,"ASReview_relevant and 1540-9538 and Barr, Tom A and Shen, Ping and Brown, Sheila and Lampropoulou, Vicky and Roch, Toralf and Lawrie, Sarah and Fan, Boli and O'Connor, Richard A and Anderton, Stephen M and Bar-Or, Amit and Fillatreau, Simon and Gray, David and G0901697/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom and CAPMC/CIHR/Canada and G0801924/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom and 095831/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom and Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2012/05/02 and J Exp Med. 2012 May 7;209(5):1001-10. doi: 10.1084/jem.20111675.

This hypothesis was tested using the mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Diestrus (<10 pg/ml in serum) levels of 17<ce><b2>-estradiol were found to significantly reduce the clinical manifestations of active EAE in both male and female mice. Estriol was also effective but at doses below those previously established for pregnancy. The reduction in disease severity was accompanied by a coincident reduction in the number and size of inflammatory foci in the CNS of estrogen (17<ce><b2>-estradiol or estriol)-treated mice. Recipients of encephalitogenic T cells from low-dose estrogen-treated mice developed less severe paralysis than mice receiving T cells from placebo-treated mice. A modest shift in Th1/Th2 balance suggested that low dose estrogen therapy could bias the immune reaction toward a protective anti-inflammatory cytokine response. However, estrogen treatment at the onset of active EAE failed to reduce disease severity, a result that is consistent with the hypothesis that naive cells are more sensitive to sex hormones than differentiated effector cells. These data suggest that treatment with low doses of estrogen can reduce the capacity of developing myelin-reactive T cells to initiate disease and challenges the idea that increased susceptibility to autoimmunity in females is dependent on homeostatic levels of estrogen.",10.4049/jimmunol.166.3.2080,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.166.3.2080,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SJL,both,7,Estriol,control,1,NA,0,0,10,NA,4,10,NA,mean,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Bebo.B.F_2001_JoofIm,JOUR,3,cytokine and estradiol and estriol and myelin and sex hormone and autoimmune encephalomyelitis and animal experiment and animal tissue and antiinflammatory activity and article and controlled study and cytokine production and diestrus and disease predisposition and disease severity and estradiol blood level and estrogen therapy and female and immune response and male and mouse and nonhuman and paralysis and priority journal and T lymphocyte and Th1 cell and Th2 cell,English,0022-1767,2080-2089,166,NA,"B.F.

Because calcitonin (CT) is believed to be released by hypercalcemia and has been shown to be anti-inflammatory, we examined whether suppression of EAE by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) could be mediated either in part or entirely by CT. Continuous administration of pharmacological doses of CT did not prevent EAE. However, a combination of CT and a subtherapeutic dose of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) additively suppressed EAE without causing hypercalcemia.

Calcium appears to be a critical component of 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated suppression of EAE, as complete disease prevention only occurs with a concomitant increase in serum calcium levels. Calcitonin (CT) is a peptide hormone released in response to acute increases in serum calcium, which led us to explore its importance in 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated suppression of EAE. Previously, we discovered that co-administration of pharmacological doses of CT enhanced the suppressive effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on EAE, suggesting CT may play a role in 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated suppression of EAE. To determine the importance of CT in EAE we have utilized a mouse strain in which the gene encoding CT and its alternative splice product, calcitonin gene related peptide-<ce><b1> (CGRP), have been deleted. Deletion of the CT/CGRP gene had no effect on EAE progression. Furthermore, treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 suppressed EAE in CT/CGRP knock-out mice equal to that in wild type mice.

F.",2010,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,UV radiation suppresses experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis independent of vitamin D production,"Although the exact cause of multiple sclerosis (MS) is unknown, a number of genetic and environmental factors are thought to influence MS susceptibility. One potential environmental factor is sunlight and the subsequent production of vitamin D. A number of studies have correlated decreased exposure to UV radiation (UVR) and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) [25(OH)D(3)] levels with an increased risk for developing MS. Furthermore, both UVR and the active form of vitamin D, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3), suppress disease in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model of MS. These observations led to the hypothesis that UVR likely suppresses disease through the increased production of vitamin D. However, UVR can suppress the immune system independent of vitamin D. Therefore, it is unclear whether UVR, vitamin D, or both are necessary for the putative decrease in MS susceptibility. We have probed the ability of UVR to suppress disease in the EAE model of MS and assessed the effect of UVR on serum 25(OH)D(3) and calcium levels. Our results indicate that continuous treatment with UVR dramatically suppresses clinical signs of EAE. Interestingly, disease suppression occurs with only a modest, transient increase in serum 25(OH)D(3) levels. Further analysis demonstrated that the levels of 25(OH)D(3) obtained upon UVR treatment were insufficient to suppress EAE independent of UVR treatment. These results suggest that UVR is likely suppressing disease independent of vitamin D production, and that vitamin D supplementation alone may not replace the ability of sunlight to reduce MS susceptibility.",10.1073/pnas.1001119107,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1001119107,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,8,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,0,0.15,16,NA,2.15,16,NA,mean,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"in a table showing clinical score at peak severity etc --> mean and SD given (this is however not the case in the clinical score graph, where no variance measure is given). ; data from activated VitD (calcitriol) extracted. this paper however also analyzed clinical score of treatment with molecule that is the middle step of the activation process ( 25-hydroxyvitamin D3), which was not extracted here (and also had lower effect size than activated VitD3).",Becklund_2010_PNASUSA,JOUR,14,"Animals and Body Weight/radiation effects and Calcium/blood and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*immunology/metabolism/*pathology and Female and Hypercalcemia/blood/etiology and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and *Ultraviolet Rays and Vitamin D/administration & dosage/*biosynthesis",eng,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424,6418-23,107,20308557,"Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, USA.",NA,NA,The authors declare no conflict of interest.,PMC2851981,45022,NLM,1153,"ASReview_relevant and 1091-6490 and Becklund, Bryan R and Severson, Kyle S and Vang, Souriya V and DeLuca, Hector F and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2010/03/24 and Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Apr 6;107(14):6418-23. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1001119107.

Thus, GA impacts both B cell survival and B cell cytokine production during CNS inflammatory disease in an EAE model.",10.1016/j.jneuroim.2009.11.016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2009.11.016,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,6.5,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,NA,1,0,6,NA,3,6,NA,mean,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Begum.Haque_2010_JN,JOUR,44958,"Animals and Antigens, CD19/metabolism and B-Cell Activating Factor/genetics/metabolism and B-Lymphocytes/drug effects and Brain/pathology and CD5 Antigens/metabolism and Cells, Cultured and Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/chemically induced/*drug and therapy/pathology and Female and Flow Cytometry/methods and Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects and Glatiramer Acetate and Glycoproteins and Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Lymph Nodes/pathology and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein and Peptide Fragments and Peptides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and RNA, Messenger/metabolism and Spleen/pathology and Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13/genetics/metabolism",eng,0165-5728,47-53,219,20034680,"Department of Medicine, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA; Multiple Sclerosis Center at Dartmouth College, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA.

Although there are potent disease-modifying agents for its initial relapsing-remitting phase, immunosuppressive therapies show limited efficacy in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Although modulation of sphingosine-1 phosphate receptors has proven beneficial during SPMS, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this project, we followed the hypothesis that siponimod, a sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor modulator, exerts protective effects by direct modulation of glia cell function (i.e., either astrocytes, microglia, or oligodendrocytes). To this end, we used the toxin-mediated, nonautoimmune MS animal model of cuprizone (Cup) intoxication. On the histological level, siponimod ameliorated cuprizone-induced oligodendrocyte degeneration, demyelination, and axonal injury. Protective effects were evident as well using GE180 translocator protein 18-kDa (TSPO) imaging with positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging or next generation sequencing (NGS). Siponimod also ameliorated the cuprizone-induced pathologies in Rag1-deficient mice, demonstrating that the protection is independent of T and B cell modulation. Proinflammatory responses in primary mixed astrocytes/microglia cell cultures were not modulated by siponimod, suggesting that other cell types than microglia and astrocytes are targeted. Of note, siponimod completely lost its protective effects in S1pr5-deficient mice, suggesting direct protection of degenerating oligodendrocytes. Our study demonstrates that siponimod exerts protective effects in the brain in a S1PR5-dependent manner. This finding is not just relevant in the context of MS but in other neuropathologies as well, characterized by a degeneration of the axon-myelin unit.",10.1073/pnas.2204509119,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2204509119,IEB,1,NA,Cup/EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,10,Siponimod,control,1,NA,NA,0,8,0,3,10,0.17,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Cup/EAE combined model,Behrangi_2022_PNASUSA,JOUR,40,"Animals and *Azetidines/pharmacology and *Benzyl Compounds/pharmacology and Cuprizone and Disease Models, Animal and Homeodomain Proteins/genetics and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and *Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Progressive/drug therapy and *Oligodendroglia/drug effects and *Sphingosine/pharmacology/therapeutic use and *Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors/metabolism and S1pr5 and multiple sclerosis and oligodendrocyte and siponimod",eng,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424,e2204509119,119,36161894,"Institute of Anatomy, Rostock University Medical Center, 18057 Rostock, Germany.

In view of their ability to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for MS, the quantitatively major malign proteins--myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP)--have been extensively studied as the relevant primary antigens in MS, and therapeutic approaches have been targeted to counteract autoimmune reactivity to MBP and PLP. Accordingly, copolymer 1, a random synthetic amino acid copolymer crossreactive with MBP and highly protective against the induction of EAE with MBP or PLP, is not being extensively tested in clinical studies as a therapeutic agent for MS. However, increasing evidence suggests that autoimmune reactivity against other CNS-specific myelin proteins could also be involved in the pathogenesis of MS. In this context, we have demonstrated that peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with MS respond predominantly to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) rather than to MBP or PLP, suggesting an important role for cell reactivity against MOG in the pathogenesis of MS. We have demonstrated that T-cell reactivity in MOG can also be pathogenic by inducing neurological disease in H-2u and H-2b mice with the same peptide of MOG, pMOG 35-55. Most interestingly, the expression of the disease differed with the different MHC backgrounds. Induction of a differentially expressed disease in different strains of mice with the same myelin antigen makes this new model particularly relevant to MS, where different expression of the disease is seen in different patients. Therefore, notwithstanding the importance of the autoimmune reactivity to MBP and PLP in MS, the potentially pathogenic autoimmune reactivity to MOG must now also be taken into consideration in therapeutic approaches to MS. In this context, we have investigated the possible effect of copolymer 1 treatment on autoimmune reactivity to MOG and on the development of EAE induced by MOG. Copolymer 1 was found to inhibit the binding of MOG peptides to MHC molecules, as well as the proliferation of MOG-reactive T cells, in a dose-dependent manner. In parallel, injection of copolymer 1 concomitantly with the encephalitogenic MOG peptide exerted a strong protective effect against the development of EAE. These preliminary data on the effect of copolymer 1 on the autoimmune response to MOG in mice indicate that copolymer 1 may also be effective in cases of MS where the autoimmune response to MOG prevails, and should therefore be further investigated in this context.",10.1007/bf00873697,https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00873697,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,NA,NA,Glatiramer acetate,NA,1,10,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ben.Nun_1996_JN,JOUR,4 Suppl 1,Animals and Autoimmunity/*drug effects and Glatiramer Acetate and Glycoproteins/*immunology and Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology and Mice and Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy and Myelin Proteins/*immunology and Peptides/*pharmacology and Time Factors,eng,0340-5354 (Print) 0340-5354,S14-22,243,8965116,"Department of Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Apr,NLM,1773,"ASReview_relevant and Ben-Nun, A and Mendel, I and Bakimer, R and Fridkis-Hareli, M and Teitelbaum, D and Arnon, R and Sela, M and Kerlero de Rosbo, N and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Germany and 1996/04/01 and J Neurol. 1996 Apr;243(4 Suppl 1):S14-22. doi: 10.1007/BF00873697.",The autoimmune reactivity to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) in multiple sclerosis is potentially pathogenic: effect of copolymer 1 on MOG-induced disease,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Marketed,NA,52

Histopathological analyses were carried out in the lumbar spinal cord at peak disease and at 1 or 14 days post-treatment (dpt). Results: Exercised-GA treated animals demonstrated decreased astrocytic response in the spinal dorsal horn with an improvement in the paw print pressure. Exercised-DMF treated animals showed an increased microglial/macrophage response on both ventral and dorsal horn that were associated with clinical improvement and synaptic motoneuron inputs density.

METHODS: DMF-incorporated SLNs and free DMF were tested in mice induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). RESULTS: Preventive treatment of free or incorporated DMF were able to reduce the EAE clinical scores, increase the weight of the animals, reduce the lesion area (demyelination and infiltration), reduce microglial fluorescence intensity and reduce the number of microglial cells and astrocytes, when compared to untreated EAE animals. Groups that received DMF had reduced numbers of T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells in the blood, when compared to the non-induced group. CONCLUSIONS: DMF incorporated in SLNs was as effective as free DMF in reducing the clinical scores of the animals, but with reduced administrations when given subcutaneously.

However, a sizable proportion of patients maintain active disease, regardless of treatment. Another approach to induce T-cell tolerance is therefore still an unmet medical need. We hypothesized that induction of mucosal tolerance toward a pro-inflammatory T-cell epitope derived from a heat shock protein (HSP) (RatP2) could translate into clinical benefit. We found that treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE, a model of MS) with the peptide RatP2 determined a significant clinical improvement, which was comparable to the standard tolerization treatment (an MBP-derived peptide pool) and superior to GA. Histological analysis demonstrated a reduction of brain and spinal cord inflammatory lesions in treated animals. Moreover, with immunological analysis we identified biomarkers associated with clinical response.

A new generation of spontaneous experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse models has been developed that mimic certain aspects of multiple sclerosis spectrum disorders. We assessed the effects of GA in the opticospinal encephalomyelitis model, which involves MOG35-55 peptide-specific T cells and B cells. A nonsignificant trend toward lower disease incidence was found for GA treatment (started on postnatal day 20). Immunohistochemical evaluations revealed no significant differences for inflammatory lesions and demyelination, cytokine production, proliferation, and cell surface markers of immune cells between GA-treated and PBS-treated (control) mice. Although a good correlation was found between the disease score of individual mice and some readout parameters (eg, immunohistochemical staining), this was not the case for others (eg, IFN-<ce><b3> production). It seems plausible that a major effect of GA lies on alternative immunological pathways, such as initiating of an immune response that is not sufficiently reflected in this spontaneous experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model. Thus, the main advantage of the opticospinal encephalomyelitis model in our hands lies in the elucidation of factors influencing the onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eg, susceptibility factors). The model seems less suitable for investigation of disease severity modifications after therapeutic interventions.",10.1016/j.ajpath.2014.03.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2014.03.009,IEB,1,NA,OSE,mouse,TCRMOGxIgHMOG,NA,NA,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,opticospinal encephalomyelitis (OSE),Bittner_2014_AJP,JOUR,7,"Animals and B-Lymphocytes/immunology and *Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology and Glatiramer Acetate and Mice, Transgenic and Peptides/*pharmacology and T-Lymphocytes/immunology",eng,0002-9440,2056-65,184,24819960,"Department of Neurology, University of MÃ¼nster, MÃ¼nster, Germany; Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research (IZKF), MÃ¼nster, Germany.

J.",2020,Ther Adv Chronic Dis,CNS delivery of anti-CD52 antibodies modestly reduces disease severity in an animal model for multiple sclerosis,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that depletes CD52-bearing B and T lymphocytes. Clinical trials defined that systemic administration of alemtuzumab reduces disease severity in the relapsing-remitting phase of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, its efficacy in progressive MS patients is limited, which may reflect the inability of alemtuzumab to cross the reconstituted BBB in these patients. Objective: to study whether central nervous system (CNS) delivery of anti-CD52 antibodies reduces disease severity and the neuroinflammatory burden in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. METHODS: Anti-CD52 antibodies were administered intrathecally during the acute and chronic phases of EAE. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry were utilized to define immunological and pathological parameters. RESULTS: We show that subcutaneously administrated anti-CD52 antibodies completely abolish EAE disease severity. CNS delivery of anti-CD52 antibodies during both the acute and chronic phases of EAE moderately reduces disease severity and the neuroinflammatory burden. Our findings further suggest that CNS delivery of anti-CD52 antibodies impacts both the peripheral and CNS immune cell compartments in the EAE model but not in healthy mice.

As an antigen-based therapy, GA induces GA-specific antibodies in treated patients and animals. GA-specific antibodies do not neutralize therapeutic effects on relapses and disability. Rather, it has been suggested that GA-specific antibodies may be associated with improved clinical outcomes. We evaluated antibody responses in eight patients with RRMS treated with GA for 15months and antibody responses in GA-treated C57BL/6 mice before and after induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). There were no significant differences from pretreatment levels of total IgE or GA-specific IgE in patients with RRMS. Total IgG1, IgG3 and GA-specific IgG4 were significantly increased at 15months of GA treatment. Antibody type and titre were not associated with clinical outcomes, i.e. expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score, disease burden on magnetic resonance images (MRI) or clinical relapses. In contrast, mice with EAE showed a marked increase in GA-specific IgE and GA-specific IgG1 antibody responses. GA-treated mice demonstrated improved clinical symptoms and lower mortality than untreated controls. Our results suggest that antibody responses to GA are heterogeneous among patients with RRMS, with no apparent association between antibody response and clinical outcomes. Clinical improvements in EAE-induced GA-treated mice suggest that GA-specific IgE and IgG1 may contribute to GA treatment effects in EAE. <c2><a9> 2011 The Authors.

Our study aims at investigating whether oral fingolimod recovers presynaptic defects that occur at different stages of disease in the CNS of EAE mice. In vivo prophylactic (0.3 mg/kg for 14 days, from the 7th day post immunization, d.p.i, the drug dissolved in the drinking water) fingolimod significantly reduced the clinical symptoms and the anxiety-related behaviour in EAE mice. Spinal cord inflammation, demyelination and glial cell activation are markers of EAE progression. These signs were ameliorated following oral fingolimod administration. Glutamate exocytosis was shown to be impaired in cortical and spinal cord terminals isolated from EAE mice at 21 <c2><b1> 1 d.p.i., while GABA alteration emerged only at the spinal cord level. Prophylactic fingolimod recovered these presynaptic defects, restoring altered glutamate and GABA release efficiency. The beneficial effect occurred in a dose-dependent, region-specific manner, since lower (0.1-0.03 mg/kg) doses restored, although to a different extent, synaptic defects in cortical but not spinal cord terminals. A delayed reduction of glutamate, but not of GABA, exocytosis was observed in hippocampal terminals of EAE mice at 35 d.p.i. Therapeutic (0.3 mg/kg, from 21 d.p.i. for 14 days) fingolimod restored glutamate exocytosis in the cortex and in the hippocampus of EAE mice at 35 <c2><b1> 1 d.p.i. but not in the spinal cord, where also GABAergic defects remained unmodified.

METHODS: A murine spontaneous chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, featuring meningeal inflammatory infiltrates resembling those in MS, was used. To prevent or treat EAE, siponimod was administered daily starting either before EAE onset or at peak of disease. The extent and cellular composition of mELT, the spinal cord parenchyma, and the spleen was assessed by histology and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Siponimod, when applied before disease onset, ameliorated EAE. This effect was also present, although less prominent, when treatment started at peak of disease. Treatment with siponimod resulted in a strong reduction of the extent of mELT in both treatment paradigms. Both B and T cells were diminished in the meningeal compartment. DISCUSSION: Beneficial effects on the disease course correlated with a reduction in mELT, suggesting that inhibition of mELT may be an additional mechanism of action of siponimod in the treatment of EAE. Further studies are needed to establish causality and confirm this observation in MS.",10.1212/nxi.0000000000001117,https://doi.org/10.1212/nxi.0000000000001117,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,TCRMOGxIgHMOG,NA,NA,Siponimod,control,1,NA,"1,2",2,7,0.25,2.7,8,0.15,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Brand_2022_NeurNeurNeur,JOUR,1,"Animals and Azetidines/*pharmacology and Benzyl Compounds/*pharmacology and Disease Models, Animal and *Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/complications/drug and therapy/prevention & control and Humans and Meninges/*drug effects/immunology and Mice and *Multiple Sclerosis/complications/drug therapy/prevention & control and Sphingosine 1 Phosphate Receptor Modulators/*pharmacology and *Tertiary Lymphoid Structures/drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control",eng,2332-7812,NA,9,34911793,"From the Department of Neurology (R.M.B., J.D., V.F., M.P., H.R., B.H., K.L.H.), School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich; Department of Neuropathology (H.R.), CharitÃ©-UniversitÃ¤tsmedizin Berlin; Munich Cluster of Systems Neurology (SyNergy) (B.H.); Comparative Experimental Pathology (CEP), Department of Pathology (K.S.), School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Germany.

We evaluated the dose-effect relationship of 1,25(OH)2D3 and sirolimus (rapamycin, RAP) in vitro, on the inhibition of PHA-stimulated PBMC proliferation, by using the median effect analysis. Pharmacological concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 (between 10(-9) and 3 x 10(-6) M) interacted synergistically with RAP (combination index value of 0.01 for 50% suppression of PBMC proliferation). In vivo, the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 and RAP combinations on the evolution of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in SJL mice was analyzed. 1,25(OH)2D3, given i.p., in monotherapy, at a dose of 2 micrograms/kg every two days, from day -3 until day +19 after disease induction, or RAP, injected daily at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg for the same period, decreased EAE incidence (paralysis in 70 and 55% of the animals, respectively, versus 98% in the placebo treated group, p < 0.001). The combination treatment using the two drugs in these subtherapeutical doses provided near-total clinical (8% paralysis, p < 0.001 compared to monotherapy with 1,25(OH)2D3 or RAP) and histological protection, comparable to that obtained with RAP in monotherapy at a threefold higher dose (1 mg/kg/d). When the two drugs were given using an alternate day administration schedule (RAP at 0.6 mg/kg and 1,25(OH)2D3 at 2 micrograms/kg, each given on alternate days from day -3 to 19), near total protection was again obtained (13% paralysis, p < 0.001 versus control). These in vitro and in vivo data support the existence of synergistic interactions between 1,25(OH)2D3 and RAP. Considering the narrow therapeutic windows of both RAP and vitamin D-related compounds in autoimmune disease models, combinations of these drugs could find clinical application in reducing their individual therapeutically efficient doses to non-toxic levels.",10.1016/s0165-5728(97)00116-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0165-5728(97)00116-1,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SJL,male,9,Vitamin D3,control,1,308,0,0,20,0,2.25,42,0.25,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Branisteanu_1997_JN,JOUR,2,"Animals and Calcitriol/*pharmacology and Cell Division/drug effects and Drug Synergism and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/prevention & control and Humans and Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology and Male and Mice and Mice, Mutant Strains and Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects and Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology and Polyenes/*pharmacology and Sirolimus",eng,0165-5728 (Print) 0165-5728,138-47,79,9394786,"Laboratory for Experimental Medicine and Endocrinology (LEGENDO), U.Z.

The present experiments examined the effects of combined treatment with subtherapeutic doses of cyclosporine A (CsA) and 1,25(OH)2D3 on the evolution of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in SJL mice. 1,25(OH)2D3 at 5 <ce><bc>g/kg body weight (given by i.p. injection every 2 days) prevented the appearance of paralysis in 70% of the treated mice.

However, when this subtherapeutic dose was associated to treatment with a daily dose of CsA (2 or 5 mg/kg/day), which by itself was subtherapeutic (24 and 50% disease-free animals, respectively), the association of both drugs led to near-total protection (86% disease-free animals when combined with the highest dose of CsA).

In contrast, the immune modulating drug FTY720 is efficacious in a variety of transplant and autoimmune models without inducing a generalized immunosuppressed state and is effective in human kidney transplantation. FTY720 elicits a lymphopenia resulting from a reversible redistribution of lymphocytes from circulation to secondary lymphoid tissues by unknown mechanisms. Using FTY720 and several analogs, we show now that FTY720 is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase; the phosphorylated compound is a potent agonist at four sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors and represents the therapeutic principle in a rodent model of multiple sclerosis.

As matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) facilitate the passage of leukocytes across matrix barriers, we tested the hypothesis that targeting MMPs could attenuate neuro-inflammation. We report that minocycline, a widely used generic drug with a good safety record, inhibited MMP activity, reduced production of MMP-9 and decreased the transmigration of T lymphocytes across a fibronectin matrix barrier. In addition, minocycline was efficacious against both mild and severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. When severe EAE was produced, minocycline pre-treatment delayed the course of the disease: when maximal disease activity occurred in vehicle-treated EAE mice, minocycline animals were relatively normal and had minimal signs of inflammation and demyelination in the CNS.

Fingolimod is a disease-modifying treatment that belongs to the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators. In addition to inhibiting T cell egress from lymph nodes, fingolimod promotes the immunosuppressive activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), whose monocytic subset (M-MDSCs) can be used as a biomarker of disease severity, as well as the degree of demyelination and extent of axonal damage in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. In the present study, we have assessed whether the abundance of circulating M-MDSCs may represent a useful biomarker of fingolimod efficacy in EAE and in the clinical context of MS patients. METHODS: Treatment with vehicle or fingolimod was orally administered to EAE mice for 14<c2><a0>days in an individualized manner, starting the day when each mouse began to develop clinical signs. Peripheral blood from EAE mice was collected previous to treatment and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from fingolimod to treat MS patients' peripheral blood. In both cases, M-MDSCs abundance was analyzed by flow cytometry and its relationship with the future clinical affectation of each individual animal or patient was assessed. RESULTS: Fingolimod-treated animals presented a milder EAE course with less demyelination and axonal damage, although a few animals did not respond well to treatment and they invariably had fewer M-MDSCs prior to initiating the treatment. Remarkably, M-MDSC abundance was also found to be an important and specific parameter to distinguish EAE mice prone to better fingolimod efficacy. Finally, in a translational effort, M-MDSCs were quantified in MS patients at baseline and correlated with different clinical parameters after 12<c2><a0>months of fingolimod treatment. M-MDSCs at baseline were highly representative of a good therapeutic response to fingolimod, i.e., patients who met at least two of the criteria used to define non-evidence of disease activity-3 (NEDA-3) 12<c2><a0>months after treatment. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that M-MDSCs might be a useful predictive biomarker of the response of MS patients to fingolimod.",10.1186/s12974-022-02635-3,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-022-02635-3,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Fingolimod,control,1,NA,2,0.95,18,0.2,2.15,19,0.2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"data type probably ""mean, SEM"", however not clear since it was not written in legend of that figure.",Camacho.Toledano_2022_JN,JOUR,1,"Humans and Animals and Mice and Fingolimod Hydrochloride/therapeutic use and *Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/pathology and *Multiple Sclerosis/drug therapy/pathology and Leukocytes, Mononuclear and *Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology and Biomarkers and Eae and MDSCs and Personalized medicine and Responder and non-responder and S1pr",eng,1742-2094,277,19,36403026,"Neuroimmuno-Repair Group, Hospital Nacional de ParaplÃ©jicos-SESCAM, Finca La Peraleda s/n, 45071, Toledo, Spain.

Treating mice with 1, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and feeding them diets high in calcium can completely suppress the induction of experimental autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Experiments described here were carried out on mice in which development of EAE was induced. Mice were fed diets containing various amounts of calcium and 1,25-dihydroxychole-calciferol. Variables measured were as follows: 1) incidence and severity of EAE; 2) serum calcium concentrations; 3) body weight; 4) total number of cells in the lymph nodes; and 5) interleukin-4 (IL-4) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) mRNA levels. When calcium was removed from the diet, the incidence of EAE was reduced 20% in both males and females. Further, the lower the dietary level of calcium, the higher was the dose of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol required to prevent the symptoms. Thus, 1, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol was found most effective in mice fed a diet adequate or high in calcium. 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol treatment of mice fed high dietary calcium resulted in a decreased number of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and increased IL-4 and TGF-beta1 mRNA levels. When calcium was omitted from the diet, 1, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol supplementation increased TGF-beta1 mRNA. Increased IL-4 mRNA and decreased lymphocytes in the lymph nodes in response to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol occurred only when dietary calcium was adequate or high. Our results suggest that dietary calcium and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol are both involved in the prevention of symptomatic EAE.",10.1093/jn/129.11.1966,https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/129.11.1966,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,B10.PL,both,7,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Cantorna_1999_JN,JOUR,11,"Animals and Body Weight/drug effects and Calcium/blood and Calcium, Dietary/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/immunology/*prevention & control and Female and Male and Mice and Sex Factors and Vitamin D/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use",eng,0022-3166 (Print) 0022-3166,1966-71,129,10539770,"Department of Biochemistry, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706, USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Nov,NLM,1659,"ASReview_relevant and Cantorna, M T and Humpal-Winter, J and DeLuca, H F and DK14881/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and United States and 1999/10/28 and J Nutr. 1999 Nov;129(11):1966-71. doi: 10.1093/jn/129.11.1966.","Dietary calcium is a major factor in 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,76

Anti-CD20 antibody is a current treatment (ocrelizumab) for multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic, inflammatory and autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). CD20-depletion has been associated with efficacy in active relapsing and progressive MS, but may not efficiently target inflammatory cells compartmentalized in the CNS. In our work, the intravenous transfer of T cells containing nanoparticle-anti-CD20 complex in mice causes B cell depletion in the spleen and in the brain, whereas the injection of anti-CD20 alone depletes B cells only in the spleen. Testing this system in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE), animal model of MS, we found that spinal cord B cell depletion ameliorates the disease course and pathology.

We therefore developed in vivo and in vitro models of post-fingolimod MS rebound to unravel its cellular and molecular mechanisms. The impact of fingolimod withdrawal on T regulatory lymphocytes was also investigated by means of cytofluorimetric analysis and antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation assays. We show that mice with relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) undergo extremely severe, chronic disease rebound upon discontinuation of fingolimod. Remarkably, rebound is preceded by a burst of S1P1 overexpression in lymph node-entrapped lymphocytes that correlates with subsequent massive lymphocyte egress and widespread CNS immune infiltration. Also, consistent with the ability of S1P1 to counteract polarization and function of T regulatory lymphocytes their number and suppression of effector T cells is reduced by fingolimod suspension.

To investigate functional changes following demyelination in a well-defined, topographically organized neuronal network, in vitro and in vivo, we focused on the primary auditory cortex (A1) of mice in the cuprizone model of general de- and remyelination. Following myelin loss in this model system, the spatiotemporal propagation of incoming stimuli in A1 was altered and the hierarchical activation of supra- and infragranular cortical layers was lost suggesting a profound effect exerted on neuronal network level. In addition, the response latency in field potential recordings and voltage-sensitive dye imaging was increased following demyelination. These alterations were accompanied by a loss of auditory discrimination abilities in freely behaving animals, a reduction of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf-2) protein in the nucleus in histological staining and persisted during remyelination. To find new strategies to restore demyelination-induced network alteration in addition to the ongoing remyelination, we tested the cytoprotective potential of dimethyl fumarate (DMF). Therapeutic treatment with DMF during remyelination significantly modified spatiotemporal stimulus propagation in the cortex, reduced the cognitive impairment, and prevented the demyelination-induced decrease in nuclear Nrf-2. These results indicate the involvement of anti-oxidative mechanisms in regulating spatiotemporal cortical response pattern following changes in myelination and point to DMF as therapeutic compound for intervention.",10.1007/s00429-018-1680-7,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-018-1680-7,IEB,1,NA,cuprizone,mouse,C57BL/6,NA,10,Dimethyl fumarate,control,1,NA,"2,3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Cerina_2018_BraiStruFunc,JOUR,7,"Animals and Anxiety and Auditory Cortex/diagnostic imaging/*pathology and Behavior Rating Scale and Cuprizone/pharmacology and Dimethyl Fumarate/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use and Disease Models, Animal and Electric Stimulation and Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use and Locomotion/drug effects and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Multiple Sclerosis/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy and NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolism and Nerve Net/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology and Neuronal Plasticity/drug effects and Remyelination/*drug effects and Voltage-Sensitive Dye Imaging and Auditory cortex and Demyelination and Multiple sclerosis and Remyelination and Spatiotemporal activity pattern and Thalamocortical system and Voltage-sensitive dye",eng,1863-2653 (Print) 1863-2653,3091-3106,223,29744572,"Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, WestfÃ¤lische Wilhelms-University, Mendelstrasse 7, 48149, MÃ¼nster, Germany. manuela.cerina@ukmuenster.de.

N.",2010,PLoS One,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibits the differentiation and migration of T(H)17 cells to protect against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","BACKGROUND: Vitamin D(3), the most physiologically relevant form of vitamin D, is an essential organic compound that has been shown to have a crucial effect on the immune responses. Vitamin D(3) ameliorates the onset of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE); however, the direct effect of vitamin D(3) on T cells is largely unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In an in vitro system using cells from mice, the active form of vitamin D(3) (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)) suppresses both interleukin (IL)-17-producing T cells (T(H)17) and regulatory T cells (Treg) differentiation via a vitamin D receptor signal. The ability of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)) to reduce the amount of IL-2 regulates the generation of Treg cells, but not T(H)17 cells. Under T(H)17-polarizing conditions, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) helps to increase the numbers of IL-10-producing T cells, but 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)'s negative regulation of T(H)17 development is still defined in the IL-10(-/-) T cells. Although the STAT1 signal reciprocally affects the secretion of IL-10 and IL-17, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) inhibits IL-17 production in STAT1(-/-) T cells. Most interestingly, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) negatively regulates CCR6 expression which might be essential for T(H)17 cells to enter the central nervous system and initiate EAE. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our present results in an experimental murine model suggest that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) can directly regulate T cell differentiation and could be applied in preventive and therapeutic strategies for T(H)17-mediated autoimmune diseases.",10.1371/journal.pone.0012925,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0012925,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,9.5,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,NA,0.2,NA,0.25,3.6,NA,0.2,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"""Data are representative of three independent experiments with at least five mice per group."" --> exact number of mice not clear, therefore ""NA""",Chang_2010_PLoOne,JOUR,9,"Animals and Calcitriol/*administration & dosage and Cell Differentiation/*drug effects and Cell Movement/drug effects and *Down-Regulation and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug and therapy/immunology/physiopathology/prevention & control and Female and Humans and Interleukin-2/immunology and Mice and Mice, Inbred BALB C and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Knockout and Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy/immunology/physiopathology/prevention & control and Protective Agents/*administration & dosage and Th17 Cells/*cytology/drug effects/immunology",eng,1932-6203,e12925,5,20886077,"Mucosal Immunology Section, Laboratory Science Division, International Vaccine Institute, Seoul, Korea.",NA,NA,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,PMC2944871,45192,NLM,1115,"ASReview_relevant and 1932-6203 and Chang, Jae-Hoon and Cha, Hye-Ran and Lee, Dong-Sup and Seo, Kyoung Yul and Kweon, Mi-Na and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2010/10/05 and PLoS One. 2010 Sep 23;5(9):e12925. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0012925.","1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibits the differentiation and migration of T(H)17 cells to protect against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis",NA,NA,20100923,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,81

In this study, we found that vitamin D receptor expression was induced in a CD4+ effector T cell lineage, Th17 cells, which required the transcription factors, ROR<ce><b1>, ROR<ce><b3>t, and STAT3. Treatment of mice with an active ligand of vitamin D receptor (VDR), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D3), ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, accompanied with reduced IL-17 and IL-17F expression. In vitro, treatment of CD4+ T cells with the physiological doses of 1,25D3 preferentially inhibited cytokine production by Th17 cells, in a VDR-dependent manner, without affecting the expression of transcription factors or surface molecules. Moreover, at these concentrations, cytokine expression was suppressed only at protein but not at mRNA levels. Stimulation of Th17 cells with 1,25D3, in a concentration-dependent manner, induced the expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a molecule involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress and translational inhibition. In addition, overexpression of CHOP in developing Th17 cells suppressed their cytokine production.

M. and Hong, J.",2009,Eur J Immunol,Regulatory effects of IFN-beta on production of osteopontin and IL-17 by CD4+ T Cells in MS,"IFN-beta currently serves as one of the major treatments for MS. Its anti-inflammatory mechanism has been reported as involving a shift in cytokine balance from Th1 to Th2 in the T-cell response against elements of the myelin sheath. In addition to the Th1 and Th2 groups, two other important pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-17 and osteopontin (OPN), are believed to play important roles in CNS inflammation in the pathogenesis of MS. In this study, we examined the potential effects of IFN-beta on the regulation of OPN and IL-17 in MS patients. We found that IFN-beta used in vitro at 0.5-3 ng/mL significantly inhibited the production of OPN in primary T cells derived from PBMC. The inhibition of OPN was determined to occur at the CD4(+) T-cell level. In addition, IFN-beta inhibited the production of IL-17 and IL-21 in CD4(+) T cells. It has been described that IFN-beta suppresses IL-17 production through the inhibition of a monocytic cytokine, the intracellular translational isoform of OPN. Our further investigation demonstrated that IFN-beta also acted directly on the CD4(+) T cells to regulate OPN and IL-17 expression through the type I IFN receptor-mediated activation of STAT1 and suppression of STAT3 activity. Administration of IFN-beta to EAE mice ameliorated the disease severity. Furthermore, spinal cord infiltration of OPN(+) and IL-17(+) cells decreased in IFN-beta-treated EAE mice along with decreases in serum levels of OPN and IL-21. Importantly, decreased OPN production by IFN-beta treatment contributes to the reduced migratory activity of T cells. Taken together, the results from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that IFN-beta treatment can down-regulate the OPN and IL-17 production in MS. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of action of IFN-beta in the treatment of MS.",10.1002/eji.200838879,https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.200838879,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,NA,NA,Interferon Beta 1,control,1,NA,1,1.9,4,0.25,3.15,4,0.5,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"drug name in paper was ""mouse IFN-beta""",Chen_2009_EJI,JOUR,9,"Adult and Animals and CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology and Cell Line, Tumor and Cell Movement/drug effects and Cells, Cultured and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/immunology and Female and Glycoproteins/pharmacology and Humans and Interferon-beta/*pharmacology and Interleukin-17/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis and Interleukins/antagonists & inhibitors/blood/metabolism and Male and Mice and Middle Aged and Multiple Sclerosis/*immunology and Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein and Osteopontin/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/blood and Peptide Fragments/pharmacology and STAT1 Transcription Factor/agonists/metabolism and STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism",eng,0014-2980,2525-36,39,19670379,"Multiple Sclerosis Research Unit, Department of Neurology and Baylor Multiple Sclerosis Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Sep,NLM,1194,"ASReview_relevant and 1521-4141 and Chen, Meiyue and Chen, Guangjie and Nie, Hong and Zhang, Xin and Niu, Xiaoyin and Zang, Ying C Q and Skinner, Sheri M and Zhang, Jingwu Z and Killian, James M and Hong, Jian and Journal Article and Germany and 2009/08/12 and Eur J Immunol. 2009 Sep;39(9):2525-36. doi: 10.1002/eji.200838879.",Regulatory effects of IFN-beta on production of osteopontin and IL-17 by CD4+ T Cells in MS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Marketed,NA,84

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that combination therapies produce a more favorable clinical outcome than monotherapy in MS treatment. Minocycline is effective in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and is a promising candidate for future MS medication. Glucocorticosteroids (GCS) belong to the most potent immunosuppressive drugs and are the mainstay for treatment of acute relapses in MS. In this study, we tested whether the combination of minocycline and prednisone (a synthetic GCS) at suboptimal doses could produce synergistic effects in EAE. Our findings showed that the combination of these two drugs functioned better than when they were individually administered in EAE mice, as evidenced by decreased clinical scores, reduced inflammation and demyelination, and improved magnetic resonance imaging outcomes. Further studies revealed that the combined treatment prevented the reduction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA expression in cerebral cortex of EAE mice. In conclusion, our findings indicated that this combination therapy suppressed disease severity of EAE partially through blocking the downregulation of neurotrophic factor expression, suggesting that the combination of minocycline and prednisone could be a novel treatment in MS.",10.1016/j.jneuroim.2009.02.016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2009.02.016,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Minocycline,control,1,NA,2,0.5,6,0.35,3.25,6,0.6,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"MRI data: only indicated in a table if enhancement and/or focal lesions present (with ""+"" and ""-"")",Chen_2009_JN,JOUR,44958,"Animals and Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use and Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/genetics and Central Nervous System/drug effects/immunology/pathology and Dose-Response Relationship, Drug and Down-Regulation/drug effects/immunology and Drug Therapy, Combination and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug and therapy/immunology/physiopathology and Female and Immunosuppression Therapy/*methods and Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Minocycline/*pharmacology/therapeutic use and Nerve Fibers, Myelinated/drug effects/immunology/pathology and Nerve Growth Factor/genetics and Prednisone/*pharmacology/therapeutic use and RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism and Treatment Outcome",eng,0165-5728,45191,210,19344957,"Department of Neurology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.",NA,NA,NA,NA,45075,NLM,1221,"ASReview_relevant and 1872-8421 and Chen, Xiaohong and Hu, Xueqiang and Zou, Yan and Pi, Rongbiao and Liu, Mei and Wang, Tieqiao and Zheng, Xueping and Liu, Meng and Lin, Mingdong and Liu, Peiqing and Tao, Liang and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Netherlands and 2009/04/07 and J Neuroimmunol. 2009 May 29;210(1-2):22-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jneuroim.2009.02.016.

Considering the tolerogenic effects of active vitamin D, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) associated with active vitamin D in EAE development. EAE was induced in female C57BL/6 mice by immunization with MOG emulsified with Complete Freund's Adjuvant plus Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Animals also received two intraperitoneal doses of Bordetella pertussis toxin. One day after immunization, mice were treated with 0,1 <ce><bc>g of 1<ce><b1>,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) every other day during 15 days (on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15). MOG (150 <ce><bc>g) was co-administered on days 3 and 11. The administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 or MOG determined significant reduction in EAE incidence and in clinical scores. When MOG was associated with 1,25(OH)2D3 the animals did not develop EAE.

Its mechanism of action is thought to be immunological through an active phosphorylated metabolite, FTY720-P, that resembles S1P and alters lymphocyte trafficking through receptor subtype S1P(1). However, previously reported expression and in vitro studies of S1P receptors suggested that direct CNS effects of FTY720 might theoretically occur through receptor modulation on neurons and glia. To identify CNS cells functionally contributing to FTY720 activity, genetic approaches were combined with cellular and molecular analyses. These studies relied on the functional assessment, based on clinical score, of conditional null mouse mutants lacking S1P(1) in CNS cell lineages and challenged by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. All conditional null mutants displayed WT lymphocyte trafficking that responded normally to FTY720. In marked contrast, EAE was attenuated and FTY720 efficacy was lost in CNS mutants lacking S1P(1) on GFAP-expressing astrocytes but not on neurons. In situ hybridization studies confirmed that astrocyte loss of S1P(1) was the key alteration in functionally affected mutants. Reductions in EAE clinical scores were paralleled by reductions in demyelination, axonal loss, and astrogliosis. Receptor rescue and pharmacological experiments supported the loss of S1P(1) on astrocytes through functional antagonism by FTY720-P as a primary FTY720 mechanism. These data identify nonimmunological CNS mechanisms of FTY720 efficacy and implicate S1P signaling pathways within the CNS as targets for multiple sclerosis therapies.",10.1073/pnas.1014154108,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1014154108,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,8,Fingolimod,control,1,NA,2,0.4,5,0.1,2,6,0.15,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Choi_2011_PNASUSA,JOUR,2,"Animals and Astrocytes/*cytology and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism and Female and Fingolimod Hydrochloride and *Gene Expression Regulation and Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology and Lymphocytes/metabolism and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Knockout and Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy and Propylene Glycols/*pharmacology and Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism and Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/*metabolism and Signal Transduction and Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology",eng,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424,751-6,108,21177428,"Department of Molecular Biology, Dorris Neuroscience Center, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.",NA,NA,Conflict of interest statement: J.C. has been a consultant for Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation.,PMC3021041,44937,NLM,1098,"ASReview_relevant and 1091-6490 and Choi, Ji Woong and Gardell, Shannon E and Herr, Deron R and Rivera, Richard and Lee, Chang-Wook and Noguchi, Kyoko and Teo, Siew Teng and Yung, Yun C and Lu, Melissa and Kennedy, Grace and Chun, Jerold and R01 DA019674/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States and R01 NS048478/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and DA019674/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States and NS048478/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2010/12/24 and Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jan 11;108(2):751-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1014154108.

Various other reports have shown a deficit in the expression of proteins associated with GABAergic neurotransmission in the neocortex of patients with multiple sclerosis and it was also demonstrated that the activation of GABAA receptors leads to an inhibition of glutamate release. Now, in order to evaluate the events that may affect the neuronal function in EAE synaptosomes, we analyzed the participation of the GABAergic system in glutamate release and in the flunitrazepam-sensitive GABAA receptor density. This revealed alterations in the GABAergic system of the frontal cortex synaptosomes from EAE animals. GABA induced a decrease in the 4-aminopyridine-evoked glutamate release in control synaptosomes which was abolished by picrotoxin, a GABAA receptor antagonist. In contrast, synaptosomes from EAE rats showed a loss in the inhibition of glutamate release mediated by GABA. Furthermore, the flunitrazepam-sensitive GABAA receptor density was decreased during the acute stage of the disease in synaptosomes from EAE rats. We also observed a loss of inhibition in the Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of synapsin I mediated by GABA in nerve terminals from EAE animals, which could explain the loss of GABAergic regulation on evoked glutamate release. The changes observed in the GABAA receptor density as well as the loss of GABAergic inhibition of glutamate release were partially reverted in cortical synaptosomes from recovered EAE animals. These results suggest that the decrease in the flunitrazepam-sensitive GABAA receptor density may explain the observed failure of GABAergic regulation in the glutamate release of synaptosomes from EAE rats, which might contribute to the appearance of clinical symptoms and disease progression.",10.1016/j.neuroscience.2011.05.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2011.05.005,IEB,1,NA,EAE,rat,Wistar,NA,6.5,Fampridine,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Fampridine was not the main focus of publication,Cid_2011_Neur,JOUR,NA,"4-Aminopyridine/pharmacology and Animals and Calcium/metabolism and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*metabolism and Flunitrazepam/pharmacology and Frontal Lobe/drug effects/*metabolism and GABA Antagonists/pharmacology and GABA Modulators/pharmacology and Glutamic Acid/*metabolism and Nerve Endings/*metabolism and Phosphorylation and Rats and Rats, Wistar and Receptors, GABA-A/metabolism and Synapsins/metabolism and Synaptosomes/drug effects/*metabolism and gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/*metabolism",eng,0306-4522,337-44,189,21635939,"Centro de Investigaciones en QuÃ­mica BiolÃ³gica de CÃ³rdoba (CIQUIBIC, CONICET-UNC), Departamento de QuÃ­mica BiolÃ³gica, Facultad de Ciencias QuÃ­micas, Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba, X5000HUA CÃ³rdoba, Argentina.",NA,NA,NA,NA,45163,NLM,1055,"ASReview_relevant and 1873-7544 and Cid, M P and Vilcaes, A A and Rupil, L L and Salvatierra, N A and Roth, G A and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2011/06/04 and Neuroscience. 2011 Aug 25;189:337-44. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2011.05.005.

AIM: Aim of our work was to analyze proteomic profile in the homogenate of cerebral cortex in mice with EAE treated with cholekalciferol (D3). METHODS: In female C57/BL6 mice, EAE was induced by standard protocol using myeline oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG 35-55), pertussis toxin and complet Freund adjuvans. Mice were divided into three groups - controls (4), EAE (4) and EAE+D3 (4). Vitamin D3 was daily taken as 100 ng of cholecalciferol within 4 weeks. Animals were daily inspected, with the determination of EAE scores and weight. Animal cerebral cortexes were taken after human decapitation and prepared as homogenates. Proteins of homogenates were separated by the 2D PAGE electrophoresis and 14 of 200 identified spots were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry on MALDI-TOF/TOF by program PDQuest. RESULTS: We have identified statistically significant changes in the level of three proteins, which might be linked to the effect of vitamin D . In mice with EAE in comparison to controls we detected 5.7 times higher level of calmodulin 1 (calm1, p = 0,00013), 14.8 times lower level of fructose -bisphosphate aldolase C (AldoC, p = 0,003), and 6.9 times lower level of aldehyddehydrogenase 1 (Aldh1a7, p = 0,013). In mice with induced EAE and treated with vitamin D3 we detected 1.5 times lower level of Calm1 (p = 0,041), 3.8 times increased level of AldoC (p = 0,033) and 4.3 times lower level of Aldh1and7 (p = 0,034) compared to the naive EAE animals. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that positive effect of vitamin D in the EAE etiopathogenesis includes at least partially an inhibition of calmodulin effect as well as the altera tions of glucose metabolism.

Natalizumab is thought to exert its therapeutic efficacy by blocking the alpha(4) integrin-mediated binding of circulating immune cells to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). As alpha(4) integrins control other immunological processes, natalizumab may, however, execute its beneficial effects elsewhere. By means of intravital microscopy we demonstrate that natalizumab specifically inhibits the firm adhesion but not the rolling or capture of human T cells on the inflamed BBB in mice with acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The efficiency of natalizumab to block T cell adhesion to the inflamed BBB was found to be more effective in EAE than in acute systemic TNF-alpha-induced inflammation.

Here we investigated the role of the crosstalk between sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and cytokine signaling cascades in astrocyte activation and inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration, and addressed the effects of fingolimod on astrocyte-neuron interaction and NO synthesis in vivo. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and confocal microscopy were used to detect S1P receptors, interleukin (IL) 1R, IL17RA, and nitrosative stress in multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) spinal cord, and the spinal cord of fingolimod-treated EAE mice. An in vitro model was established to study the effects of S1P, IL1, and IL17 stimulation on NFkB translocation and NO production in astrocytes, on spinal neuron survival, and on astrocyte-neuron interaction. Furthermore, fingolimod efficacy in blocking astrocyte-mediated neurodegeneration was evaluated. RESULTS: We found coordinated upregulation of IL1R, IL17RA, S1P1, and S1P3 together with nitrosative markers in astrocytes within MS and EAE lesions. In vitro studies revealed that S1P, IL17, and IL1 induced NF<ce><ba>B translocation and NO production in astrocytes, and astrocyte conditioned media triggered neuronal death. Importantly, fingolimod blocked the 2 activation events evoked in astrocytes by either S1P or inflammatory cytokines, resulting in inhibition of astrocyte-mediated neurodegeneration.

Implications for the mechanisms involved in disease perpetuation","Several laboratories including ours have shown that T cell co-stimulation mediated through B7-1 or B7-2 is critical to the initiation of EAE. The role of T cell co-stimulation in ongoing EAE is less clear. In the present study, 32 mice with established EAE were randomly assigned to receive treatment with either CTLA-4-Fc or control Ig. Mice were followed daily by clinical scoring for 2 months post-immunization. A significant improvement in the degree of recovery following the acute episode and following relapses of EAE was observed in those mice randomized to CTLA-4-Fc treatment. Full clinical remission occurred twice as often in the CTLA-4-Fc group as in those mice receiving placebo, whereas placebo-treated mice were more likely to develop a stable prolonged neurologic deficit. Serial clinical scoring revealed no effect of CTLA-4-Fc upon relapse rate, with greater than 80% of the mice in each group displaying at least one clinical EAE relapse. In that the activation of memory T cells is relatively independent of T cell co-stimulation, these results indicate that development of chronic disease is associated with the activation of naive T cells and the recruitment of the latter cells into the disease process.

In contrast, the effector phases of EAE were relatively unaffected by similar treatments using MHC class II antigen (Ag)-specific mAb and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)4-Ig fusion proteins in some studies. This has been attributed to different sensitivities of effector cell function or the poor penetrance of inhibitory proteins into the central nervous system (CNS). To examine this question further, MHC class II Ag-specific mAb and CTLA4-Ig were delivered directly into the CNS following EAE induction, and both were found to inhibit disease. While it was found that systemic administration of mouse CTLA4-Ig could also inhibit the progression of effector immune responses when administered shortly before or during clinical disease, these were significantly more active when delivered directly into the CNS, which probably involved an action on both CD28 ligands, CD80 and CD86. Although mouse CTLA4-human Ig was therapeutically less efficient than mouse CTLA4-mouse Ig protein, probably due to the enhanced immunogenicity and lower functional activity, gene delivery of CTLA4-human Ig into the CNS using a non-replicating adenoviral vector was more effective than a single injection of CTLA4-human Ig protein. Gene delivery significantly ameliorated the development of EAE, without necessarily inhibiting unrelated peripheral immune responsiveness. Local gene delivery of CTLA4-Ig may thus be an important target for immunotherapy of human autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis.",10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199812)28:12<3904::AID-IMMU3904>3.0.CO;2-5,https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199812)28:12<3904::AID-IMMU3904>3.0.CO;2-5,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,Biozzi ABH,NA,NA,Abatacept,control,1,NA,2,1.1,8,0.05,3.8,8,0.15,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"different application forms compared: central vs systemical application, and also gene delivery --> gene delivery was not considered, from the other application forms the largest effect size was extracted.; drug just called ""CTLA4-Ig"" in paper (they do not mention abatacept in publication, we however have listed CTLA4-Ig as a ""synonym"" for abatacept in our drug list)",Croxford_1998_EuJoofIm,JOUR,12,cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 and fusion protein and immunoglobulin and major histocompatibility antigen class 2 and monoclonal antibody and Adenoviridae and autoimmune encephalomyelitis and animal experiment and animal tissue and article and central nervous system and controlled study and gene therapy and immunotherapy and intracerebral drug administration and intraperitoneal drug administration and mouse and nonhuman and priority journal,English,0014-2980,3904-3916,28,NA,"J.L.

This approval was accomplished through an Abbreviated New Drug Application that demonstrated equivalence to Copaxone. Method: This article will provide an overview of the methods used to establish the biological and immunological equivalence of the two glatiramer acetate products, including methods evaluating antigenpresenting cell (APC) biology, T-cell biology, and other immunomodulatory effects. Results: In vitro and in vivo experiments from multiple redundant orthogonal assays within four biological processes (aggregate biology, APC biology, T-cell biology, and B-cell biology) modulated by glatiramer acetate in MS established the biological and immunological equivalence of Glatopa and Copaxone and are described. The following were observed when comparing Glatopa and Copaxone in these experiments: equivalent delays in symptom onset and reductions in <e2><80><9c>disease<e2><80><9d> intensity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; equivalent dose-dependent increases in Glatopa-and Copaxone-induced monokine-induced interferon-gamma release from THP-1 cells; a shift to a T helper 2 phenotype resulting in the secretion of interleukin (IL)-4 and downregulation of IL-17 release; no differences in immunogenicity and the presence of equivalent <e2><80><9c>immunofingerprints<e2><80><9d> between both versions of glatiramer acetate; and no stimulation of histamine release with either glatiramer acetate in basophilic leukemia 2H3 cell lines.

Long-chain lipophilic amino alcohols with immunoregulatory activities have already been studied in some models of inflammatory diseases, but the action of these compounds in EAE and MS is still unknown. In this study, we investigated whether the lipophilic amino alcohol 4b would act to improve the clinical signs of EAE and reduce the demyelination process and the neuroinflammatory parameters in the spinal cord, as well as the inflammatory process in the inguinal lymph nodes, of C57Bl/6 mice induced with EAE after stimulation with MOG(35-55) and pertussis toxin. The 4b treatment (1.0<c2><a0>mg/kg/day) was orally administered, starting on the day of onset of clinical signs of the disease (10th) and ending on the 20th day after immunization. This treatment was able to reduce the cell count on the inguinal lymph nodes, the migration of inflammatory cells into the central nervous system (CNS), as well as the processes of microgliosis, astrogliosis, and the production of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus increasing the IL-10 anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in EAE mice. The inhibition of Akt phosphorylation in the CNS of EAE mice after treatment with 4b indicates that the immunoregulatory action of 4b is related to the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Our results indicate the immunoregulatory efficacy of the new compound 4b in the control of some inflammatory parameters and in the glial proliferation. In addition, 4b was able to reduce the demyelination of neurons and the worsening of clinical signs of EAE as effectively as the compound FTY720, the first oral drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of MS.",10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106919,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106919,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Fingolimod,control,1,68,2,0,17,0,5.3,17,2.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,da.Silva_2020_IntImm,JOUR,NA,"Amino Alcohols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Animals and Cytokines/immunology and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology and Female and Immunologic Factors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Lymph Nodes/drug effects/immunology and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*immunology and Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*immunology and Signal Transduction/drug effects and Spinal Cord/drug effects/immunology and Akt and Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and Fingolimod analogue and Multiple sclerosis and Pi3k",eng,1567-5769,106919,88,32871475,"Department of Parasitology, Microbiology and Immunology, Federal University of Juiz de Fora, Juiz de Fora 36036-900, Brazil.

Cyclotides are small plant proteins with a wide range of biological activity, making them a target for researchers to investigate. This study was conducted to investigate the possible effects of cyclotide-rich fractions from Viola odorata as an immunomodulatory agent in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. METHODS: At room temperature, the plant materials were subjected to maceration in methanol: dichloromethane (1:1; v/v) for 3 days. The extraction was repeated 3 times, and the final concentrated extract was partitioned 3 times by 1/2 volume of double-distilled water. The aqueous phases were separated and freeze-dried. Finally, the crude extract was fractionated by C18 silicagel using vacuum liquid chromatography, with mobile phases of 30%, 50% and 80% of ethanol: water, respectively. The 50%, and 80% fractions were analyzed by HPLC and MALDI-TOF analysis and administrated intraperitoneally to forty-five female C57BL/6 EAE-induced mice, at 5, 25, and 50 mg/kg doses. After 28 days, the animals were evaluated using EAE clinical scoring which was done every 3 days, cytokine levels, and myelination level. RESULTS: The results confirmed the presence of cyclotides in V. odorata based on their retention time and the composition of mobile phase in HPLC and the molecular weight of the peaks in MALDI-TOF analysis. It was observed that cyclotides, especially in the 80% fraction group at the dose of 50 mg/kg significantly reduced the clinical scores, inflammation, and demyelination in EAE mice compared with the normal saline group (P<0.05), and the results of this group were comparable with fingolimod (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: It could be concluded that V. odorata is a rich source of cyclotides which they could be extracted by an easily available process and also, they could be used as immunomodulatory agents in MS, with similar effects to fingolimod.",10.1016/j.msard.2022.103958,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2022.103958,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Fingolimod,control,1,50,1,0.5,4,NA,1.8,4,0.45,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,variance measure for all groups (in same graph) except fingolimod...,Dayani_2022_MultScleRelaDiso,JOUR,NA,"Amino Acid Sequence and Animals and *Cyclotides/chemistry/pharmacology and *Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/drug therapy and Female and Fingolimod Hydrochloride and Inflammation and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and *Multiple Sclerosis/complications/drug therapy and *Viola/chemistry and Water and Cyclotides and Eae and Immunomodulation and Multiple sclerosis and Viola odorata",eng,2211-0348,103958,64,35716476,"Novel Drug Delivery Systems Research Centre, Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran; Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy and Novel Drug Delivery Systems Research Centre, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.

We investigated whether behavioral parameters in addition to clinical motor function scores could be used to assess treatment efficacy during score-free intervals in the relapsing-remitting EAE model in SJL/J mice. We studied the effects of the clinical reference compounds FTY720 (fingolimod, 0.5mg/kg/day) and dimethyl fumarate (DMF, 20-30 mg/kg/day) on clinical scores in several rodent EAE models in order to generate efficacy profiles. SJL/J mice with relapsing-remitting EAE were studied using behavioral tests, including rotarod, gait analysis, locomotor activity and grip strength. SJL/J mice were also examined according to Crawley's sociability and preference for social novelty test. Prophylactic treatment with FTY720 prevented clinical scores in three of the four EAE rodent models: Dark Agouti (DA) and Lewis rats and C57BL/6J mice. Neither prophylactic nor late-therapeutic treatment with FTY720 reduced clinical scores or reversed deficits in the rotarod test in SJL/J mice, but we observed effects on motor functions and sociability in the absence of clinical scores. Prophylactic treatment with FTY720 improved the gait of SJL/J mice whereas late-therapeutic treatment improved manifestations of reduced social (re)cognition or preference for social novelty. DMF was tested in three EAE models and did not improve clinical scores at the dose used.

MS therapy is based on immunomodulatory drugs that reduce disease recurrence and severity. Vitamin D is a hormone whose immunomodulatory ability has been widely demonstrated, including in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is an animal model of CNS inflammation. In this study, we evaluated the potential of very early intervention with the active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) to control neuroinflammation during EAE development. EAE was induced in C57BL/6J mice and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 administration began 1 day after disease induction. This procedure decreased prevalence, clinical score, inflammation, and demyelination. It also reduced MHCII expression in macrophages and microglia as well as the level of oxidative stress and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression for NLRP3, caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-1<ce><b2>, CX(3)CR1, CCL17, RORc and Tbx21 at the CNS. Otherwise, mRNA expression for ZO-1 increased at the lumbar spinal cord. These effects were accompanied by the stabilization of blood-spinal cord barrier permeability. The results of this study indicate that early intervention with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 can control the neuroinflammatory process that is the hallmark of EAE and MS immunopathogenesis and should thus be explored as an adjunct therapy for MS patients.",10.3389/fphar.2020.00161,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.00161,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,9,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,1,0.25,21,0.15,3.4,3,0.65,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,de.Oliveira_2020_FronPhar,JOUR,NA,"1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and blood-brain barrier and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and inflammasome and oxidative stress",eng,1663-9812 (Print) 1663-9812,161,11,32226379,"Department of Tropical Diseases, Botucatu Medical School, SÃ£o Paulo State University (UNESP), Botucatu, Brazil.

The passage of T cells through the blood-brain barrier can be suppressed with antibodies directed against alpha-4 integrins (VLA-4) that mediate T-cell adherence. This treatment, in phase III of clinical trial evaluation, reduces lesion development in MS patients. In the ongoing inflammatory disease process the consequences of T-cell inhibitory anti-VLA-4 antibodies on inflammatory compounds are still poorly investigated. We show that anti-VLA-4 antibody treatment during the late preclinical phase of the acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) MS rat model interrupts T-cell egress out of the vascular compartment and suppresses clinical disease and histological alterations but macrophage recruitment in the CNS is not fully compromised. Among the treated EAE animals not developing disease, none presented foci of T-cell infiltration in CNS. However, in 75% of the treated EAE rats monocyte ingress in CNS was observed in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging with the ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide contrast agent.

METHODS: In vitro and ex vivo immunologic studies coupled with flow cytometry were performed to evaluate the action of fingolimod on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of activation markers in human monocytes from healthy participants, participants with untreated MS, and participants with fingolimod-treated MS. In vivo administration of fingolimod during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was established to verify the activation state of splenic, CNS infiltrating, and CNS resident myeloid cells ex vivo at flow cytometer. RESULTS: We found that in vitro exposure of human monocytes to fingolimod inhibited LPS-induced CD25 and CD150 expression and tumor necrosis factor-<ce><b1> (TNF-<ce><b1>) secretion without altering immune cell survival. Further, EAE treatment with fingolimod led to reduced amounts of TNF-<ce><b1> produced by myeloid cells in vivo in the spleen and CNS. Finally, while displaying normal induction of CD25 and CD150 levels at high LPS concentration, monocytes from patients with fingolimod-treated MS showed significantly higher activation threshold at suboptimal LPS stimulation than controls.

METHODS: Mouse MRI was used to investigate remyelination in the cuprizone model. We then used a conditional demyelination Xenopus laevis model to assess the dose-response of siponimod on remyelination. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis-optic neuritis (EAEON) in C57Bl/6J mice, we monitored the retinal thickness and the visual acuity using optical coherence tomography and optomotor response. Optic nerve inflammatory infiltrates, demyelination, and microglial and oligodendroglial differentiation were assessed by immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR, and bulk RNA sequencing. RESULTS: An increased remyelination was observed in the cuprizone model. Siponimod treatment of demyelinated tadpoles improved remyelination in comparison to control in a bell-shaped dose-response curve. Siponimod in the EAEON model attenuated the clinical score, reduced the retinal degeneration, and improved the visual function after prophylactic and therapeutic treatment, also in a bell-shaped manner.

METHODS: Mouse MRI was used to investigate remyelination in the cuprizone model. We then used a conditional demyelination Xenopus laevis model to assess the dose-response of siponimod on remyelination. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis-optic neuritis (EAEON) in C57Bl/6J mice, we monitored the retinal thickness and the visual acuity using optical coherence tomography and optomotor response. Optic nerve inflammatory infiltrates, demyelination, and microglial and oligodendroglial differentiation were assessed by immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR, and bulk RNA sequencing. RESULTS: An increased remyelination was observed in the cuprizone model. Siponimod treatment of demyelinated tadpoles improved remyelination in comparison to control in a bell-shaped dose-response curve. Siponimod in the EAEON model attenuated the clinical score, reduced the retinal degeneration, and improved the visual function after prophylactic and therapeutic treatment, also in a bell-shaped manner. Inflammatory infiltrates and demyelination of the optic nerve were reduced, the latter even after therapeutic treatment, which also shifted microglial differentiation to a promyelinating phenotype.

The presumed mode of action is via blockade of axonal voltage gated potassium channels, thereby enhancing conduction in demyelinated axons. In this study, we provide evidence that in addition to those symptomatic effects, 4-AP can prevent neuroaxonal loss in the CNS. Using in vivo optical coherence tomography imaging, visual function testing and histologic assessment, we observed a reduction in retinal neurodegeneration with 4-AP in models of experimental optic neuritis and optic nerve crush. These effects were not related to an anti-inflammatory mode of action or a direct impact on retinal ganglion cells. Rather, histology and in vitro experiments indicated 4-AP stabilization of myelin and oligodendrocyte precursor cells associated with increased nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells. In experimental optic neuritis, 4-AP potentiated the effects of immunomodulatory treatment with fingolimod. As extended release 4-AP is already licensed for symptomatic multiple sclerosis treatment, we performed a retrospective, multicentre optical coherence tomography study to longitudinally compare retinal neurodegeneration between 52 patients on continuous 4-AP therapy and 51 matched controls. In line with the experimental data, during concurrent 4-AP therapy, degeneration of the macular retinal nerve fibre layer was reduced over 2 years. These results indicate disease-modifying effects of 4-AP beyond symptomatic therapy and provide support for the design of a prospective clinical study using visual function and retinal structure as outcome parameters.",10.1093/brain/awaa062,https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa062,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,NA,Fampridine,control,1,NA,"0,1,2",1.4,12,0.3,3.2,12,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Dietrich_2020_Brai,JOUR,4,"4-Aminopyridine/*pharmacology and Adult and Aged and Animals and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/pathology and Female and Humans and Male and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Middle Aged and Multiple Sclerosis/*pathology and Neural Stem Cells/drug effects and Neuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology and Optic Neuritis/*pathology and Potassium Channel Blockers/pharmacology and Rats and Rats, Wistar and Retinal Degeneration/*pathology and 4-aminopyridine and Nfat and experimental optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis and optical coherence tomography",eng,0006-8950,1127-1142,143,32293668,"Department of Neurology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.

Disease-modifying agents slow down the progression of multiple sclerosis and prevent relapses, yet it remains unclear if they yield analgesia. We explored the analgesic potential of fingolimod (FTY720), an agonist and/or functional antagonist at the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), because it reduces hyperalgesia in models of peripheral inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We used a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35 to 55 (MOG35-55) mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, modified to avoid frank paralysis, and thus, allow for assessment of withdrawal behaviors to somatosensory stimuli. Daily intraperitoneal fingolimod reduced behavioral signs of central neuropathic pain (mechanical and cold hypersensitivity) in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. Both autoimmune encephalomyelitis and fingolimod changed hyperalgesia before modifying motor function, suggesting that pain-related effects and clinical neurological deficits were modulated independently. Fingolimod also reduced cellular markers of central sensitization of neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord: glutamate-evoked Ca signaling and stimulus-evoked phospho-extracellular signal-related kinase ERK (pERK) expression, as well as upregulation of astrocytes (GFAP) and macrophage/microglia (Iba1) immunoreactivity. The antihyperalgesic effects of fingolimod were prevented or reversed by the S1PR1 antagonist W146 (1 mg/kg daily, i.p.) and could be mimicked by either repeated or single injection of the S1PR1-selective agonist SEW2871. Fingolimod did not change spinal membrane S1PR1 content, arguing against a functional antagonist mechanism. We conclude that fingolimod behaves as an S1PR1 agonist to reduce pain in multiple sclerosis by reversing central sensitization of spinal nociceptive neurons.",10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001106,https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001106,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,8,Fingolimod,control,1,144,2,0.65,5.5,0.25,2.85,5.5,0.15,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Doolen_2018_Pain,JOUR,2,"Anilides/pharmacology and Animals and Central Nervous System Sensitization/*drug effects and Disease Models, Animal and Female and Fingolimod Hydrochloride/*therapeutic use and Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use and Male and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Motor Activity/drug effects and Multiple Sclerosis/chemically induced/*complications/drug therapy and Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein/toxicity and *Neuralgia/drug therapy/etiology/pathology and Organophosphonates/pharmacology and Oxadiazoles/pharmacology and Pain Threshold/drug effects and Peptide Fragments/toxicity and Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/*metabolism and Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors and Spinal Cord/metabolism/pathology and Spinal Nerve Roots/drug effects/*metabolism and Subcellular Fractions/drug effects/metabolism and Thiophenes/pharmacology and eIF-2 Kinase/metabolism",eng,0304-3959 (Print) 0304-3959,224-238,159,29140922,"Department of Physiology and the Center for Analgesia Research Excellence, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, USA.

Blockade of this enzyme by atorvastatin (AT) inhibits the destructive proinflammatory T helper cell (Th)1 response during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. Here we present evidence linking specific isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway to signaling pathways that regulate T cell autoimmunity. We demonstrate that the isoprenoid geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP) mediates proliferation, whereas both GGPP and its precursor, farnesyl-PP, regulate the Th1 differentiation of myelin-reactive T cells. Depletion of these isoprenoid intermediates in vivo via oral AT administration hindered these T cell responses by decreasing geranylgeranylated RhoA and farnesylated Ras at the plasma membrane. This was associated with reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 phosphorylation and DNA binding of their cotarget c-fos in response to T cell receptor activation. Inhibition of ERK and p38 mimicked the effects of AT and induced a Th2 cytokine shift. Thus, by connecting isoprenoid availability to regulation of Th1/Th2 fate, we have elucidated a mechanism by which AT may suppress Th1-mediated central nervous system autoimmune disease.",10.1084/jem.20051129,https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20051129,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SJL,female,8,Atorvastatin,control,1,NA,0,0.95,10,0.35,3.8,10,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Dunn_2006_JEM,JOUR,2,"Animals and Atorvastatin and Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/immunology and Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism and Cell Proliferation/drug effects and Cells, Cultured and Cholesterol/blood and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/drug therapy/*immunology and Female and Heptanoic Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology and Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/pharmacology and Mice and Mice, Inbred Strains and Mice, Transgenic and Protein Prenylation/drug effects and Pyrroles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology and Terpenes/*pharmacology and Th1 Cells/cytology/drug effects/*immunology and Th2 Cells/cytology/drug effects/*immunology and ras Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology and rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism",eng,0022-1007 (Print) 0022-1007,401-12,203,16476765,"Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.",NA,NA,NA,PMC2118212,44977,NLM,1392,"ASReview_relevant and 1540-9538 and Dunn, Shannon E and Youssef, Sawsan and Goldstein, Matthew J and Prod'homme, Thomas and Weber, Martin S and Zamvil, Scott S and Steinman, Lawrence and 835/MSS_/Multiple Sclerosis Society/United Kingdom and R01 AI059709/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and R01AI05709/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2006/02/16 and J Exp Med. 2006 Feb 20;203(2):401-12. doi: 10.1084/jem.20051129.

CD28 engagement results in T cell activation, differentiation and survival while CTLA-4 signals block IL-2 production, cell cycle progression and T cell differentiation. We explored the role of CTLA-4 in peripheral tolerance induced by intravenous administration of ethylene carbodiimide-fixed, antigen-coupled splenocytes in the PLP139 - 151-induced relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis system. Tolerance induction with PLP139 - 151-coupled splenocytes correlates with low B7 expression on the fixed antigen-presenting cells, conditions that would favor CTLA-4-mediated inhibition. Administration of CTLA-4Ig or anti-CTLA-4 concomitant with the 'tolerogenic' stimulus, however, failed to reverse tolerance induction. In contrast, blocking CTLA-4 at the time of secondary 'immunogenic' encounter with antigen reversed the tolerant state. These findings indicate that CTLA-4 is required to maintain the unresponsive state of the tolerized T cells upon antigenic stimulation under inflammatory conditions and, therefore, have important implications for therapeutic regulation of autoimmune disease.",10.1002/1521-4141(200204)32:4<972::Aid-immu972>3.0.Co;2-m,https://doi.org/10.1002/1521-4141(200204)32:4<972::Aid-immu972>3.0.Co;2-m,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SJL,female,6.5,Abatacept,control,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,drug name in publication: CTLA-4Ig (--> according to our list synonym of Abatacept),Eagar_2002_EJI,JOUR,4,"Abatacept and Amino Acid Sequence and Animals and Antigens, CD/immunology and Antigens, Differentiation/administration & dosage/*immunology/pharmacology and Autoantigens/administration & dosage/immunology and Autoimmune Diseases/immunology/therapy and B7-1 Antigen/immunology and B7-2 Antigen and CTLA-4 Antigen and Capsid/immunology and Capsid Proteins and Cells, Cultured/immunology and Clonal Anergy/immunology and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/immunology/therapy and Female and Hypersensitivity, Delayed/immunology and *Immune Tolerance and Immunization and *Immunoconjugates and Inflammation and Lymphocyte Activation and Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology and Mice and Mice, Mutant Strains and Molecular Sequence Data and Myelin Basic Protein/immunology and Myelin Proteolipid Protein/administration & dosage/immunology and Ovalbumin/immunology and Peptide Fragments/administration & dosage/immunology and Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology and Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms and T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology and Thymectomy",eng,0014-2980 (Print) 0014-2980,972-81,32,11920563,"Department of Microbiology-Immunology and Interdepartmental Immunobiology Center, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Apr,NLM,1558,"ASReview_relevant and Eagar, Todd N and Karandikar, Nitin J and Bluestone, Jeffrey A and Miller, Stephen D and AI35225/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and AI35294/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and CA40216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States and NS 26543/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and NS 30871/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and NS 34819/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and Germany and 2002/03/29 and Eur J Immunol. 2002 Apr;32(4):972-81. doi: 10.1002/1521-4141(200204)32:4<972::AID-IMMU972>3.0.CO;2-M.",The role of CTLA-4 in induction and maintenance of peripheral T cell tolerance,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,117

Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction was evident by leakage of the tracer sodium fluorescein, along with reduced expression of claudin-5 by endothelial cells and desmin by pericytes. Immunohistological and ultrastructural analyses revealed detachment of the astroglial cell bodies from the blood vessels and loss of their connections with both the blood vessels and the neuronal synapses. Furthermore, examination of individual astrocytic processes at cortical layer IV, where well-defined neuronal columns (barrels) are linked to functional properties, revealed loss of astrocytic confinement to the functional neuronal boundaries. Thus, in contrast to the highly modulated patches of astrocyte processes in na<c3><af>ve mice overlapping the barrel cores, in EAE-mice process distribution was uniform ignoring the barrel boundaries. These aberrations are attributed to the surrounding inflammation, indicated by T-cells presence in the cortex as well as in the subcortical white matter and the meninges. Immunomodulatory treatment with glatiramer acetate partially abrogated the neurovascular damage. These combined findings indicate that under inflammatory conditions, activated perivascular astrocytes fail in neuro-hemodynamic coupling, resulting in obstructed cross-talk between the blood vessels and the neurons.

A number of ion channels have been implicated in the progression of MS, most notably in cell types involved in the immune response. In the present study, we investigated the implication of two ion channel isoforms, Kv1.1 and Kv1.3, in experimental models of neuroinflammation and demyelination. Immunohistochemical staining of brain sections from the mouse cuprizone model displayed high levels Kv1.3 expression. In an astroglial cellular model of inflammation, stimulation with LPS resulted also in a higher expression of Kv1.1 and Kv1.3, while the introduction of 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) exacerbated the release of pro-inflammatory chemokine CXCL10. In the oligodendroglial cellular model of demyelination, the alteration in expression levels of Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 may be correlated with that of MBP levels. Indirect co-culture was attempted to further understand the communication between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, The addition of reactive astrocytes<e2><80><99> secretome significantly inhibited the production of MBP, this inhibition was accompanied by an alteration in the expression of Kv1.1 and Kv1.3. The addition of 4-AP in this case did not alleviate the decrease in MBP production. In conclusion, the use of 4-AP generated controversial results, suggesting 4-AP may be used in the early stages of the disease or in the remission phases to stimulate myelination, yet in induced toxic inflammatory environment, 4-AP exacerbated this effect.",10.1016/j.bbrc.2023.02.066,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2023.02.066,IEB,1,NA,cuprizone,mouse,C57BL/6,female,NA,Fampridine,control,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Elbini_2023_BioandBioResCom,JOUR,NA,animal cell and animal experiment and animal model and animal tissue and article and astrocyte and brain and coculture and controlled study and demyelination and immunohistochemistry and inflammation and male and mouse and multiple sclerosis and myelination and nervous system inflammation and nonhuman and oligodendroglia and protein expression and remission and secretome and cuprizone and endogenous compound and fampridine and gamma interferon inducible protein 10 and lipopolysaccharide and potassium channel and potassium channel Kv1.1 and potassium channel Kv1.3,English,1090-2104 0006-291X,140-146,653,NA,"I.

Here, we show CD52 expression in murine neurons, astrocytes and microglia, both in vitro and in vivo.

We investigated the phenotype and migration of memory versus effector T cells in vivo in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found that memory CD4+ T cells up-regulated the activation marker CD44 as well as CXCR3 and ICOS, proliferated more and produced more interferon-<ce><b3> and less interleukin-17 compared to effector T cells. Moreover, adoptive transfer of memory T cells into T cell receptor (TCR)<ce><b1><ce><b2>-/- recipients induced more severe disease than did effector CD4+ T cells with marked central nervous system inflammation and axonal damage. The uniqueness of disease mediated by memory T cells was confirmed by the differential susceptibility to immunomodulatory therapies in vivo. CD28-B7 T cell costimulatory signal blockade by CTLA4Ig suppressed effector cell-mediated EAE but had minimal effects on disease induced by memory cells. In contrast, ICOS-B7h blockade exacerbated effector T cell-induced EAE but protected from disease induced by memory T cells. However, blockade of the OX40 (CD134) costimulatory pathway ameliorated disease mediated by both memory and effector T cells.

Also, Reactive Oxygen Species seem to be involved in the course of MS. In this study, it has been aimed to relate all these variables starting from an analysis of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding protein (LBP) with the determination of parameters related to oxidative stress in the blood, brain and spinal cord. For this purpose, samples obtained from EAE rats and relapsing-remitting (RRMS) MS patients were used. In addition, EAE rats were treated with Natalizumab, N-acetyl-cysteine and dimethyl fumarate. Natalizumab was also employed in RRMS.

In this study, we measured gene expression in mouse spinal cord during myelin oligodendrocyte gp35-55 peptide-induced EAE, using quantitative RT-PCR, to identify gene markers that monitor individual hallmark pathological processes. We defined a small panel of genes whose longitudinal expression patterns provided insight into the timing, interrelationships, and mechanisms of individual disease processes and the efficacy of therapeutics for the treatment of MS. Earliest transcriptional changes were upregulation of Il17a and sharp downregulation of neuronal and oligodendrocyte marker genes preceding clinical disease onset, whereas neuroinflammatory markers progressively increased as symptoms and tissue lesions developed. EAE-induced gene-expression changes were not altered in mice deficient in IKK<ce><b2> in cells of the myeloid lineage compared with controls, but the administration of a selective inhibitor of soluble TNF to mice from the day of immunization delayed changes in the expression of innate inflammation, myelin, and neuron markers from the presymptomatic phase. Proof of principle that the gene panel shows drug screening potential was obtained using a well-established MS therapeutic, glatiramer acetate. Prophylactic treatment of mice with glatiramer acetate normalized gene marker expression, and this correlated with the level of therapeutic success. These results show that neurons and oligodendrocytes are highly sensitive to CNS-directed autoimmunity before the development of clinical symptoms and immunopathology and reveal a role for soluble TNF in mediating the earliest changes in gene expression.",10.4049/jimmunol.1300633,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1300633,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,10,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,NA,0,1.2,14,0.5,2.6,13,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Evangelidou_2014_JI,JOUR,9,"Animals and Biomarkers/analysis and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*genetics/metabolism/pathology and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Knockout and Multiple Sclerosis/*genetics/pathology and Neurons/*metabolism and Oligodendroglia/*metabolism and Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction and Spinal Cord/*metabolism/pathology and *Transcriptome",eng,0022-1767,4122-33,192,24683189,"Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, 11521 Athens, Greece.",NA,NA,NA,NA,45047,NLM,832,"ASReview_relevant and 1550-6606 and Evangelidou, Maria and Karamita, Maria and Vamvakas, Sotiris-Spyros and Szymkowski, David E and Probert, Lesley and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2014/04/01 and J Immunol. 2014 May 1;192(9):4122-33. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1300633.

Continued lymphocyte activity in the brain, microglia-mediated injury, iron deposition, and oxidative stress are characteristics of progressive MS. OBJECTIVE: As minocycline and hydroxychloroquine have been shown to inhibit microglia, we evaluated their effects on other outcomes relevant for progression. METHODS: Medications were evaluated in culture and in mice with acute and chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). RESULTS: Both medications individually reduced iron neurotoxicity and a combination effect was not observed. Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was manifested by minocycline only. Minocycline reduced T-cell proliferation more prominently than hydroxychloroquine; an aggregate effect occurred at low but not high concentrations. B-cell proliferation was mitigated to a greater extent by hydroxychloroquine and an additive effect was not evident. In EAE, suboptimal doses of minocycline and hydroxychloroquine individually delayed onset of clinical signs, while their combination suppressed clinical manifestations until treatment was stopped. In Biozzi ABH mice, a model of progressive MS, the chronic phase was beneficially altered using the combination. CONCLUSION: While minocycline and hydroxychloroquine did not manifest additive effects in most culture assays, their combination at suboptimal doses in EAE unexpectedly exceeded their individual activity.

AIM: The purpose of this study was exploring the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of vitamin D3 in encephalomyelitis (EAE). METHODS: We treated monophasic experimental autoimmune EAE, induced in Lewis rat, with vitamin D3 and adoptively transfer tolerogenic bone marrow-derived DCs generated in the presence of vitamin D3. RESULTS: This study provides evidence that the in vivo administration of vitamin D3, as well as the adoptive transfer of vitamin D3 -induced IDO(+) immature/tolerogenic dendritic cells, leads to a significant increase in the percentage of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in the lymph nodes in a rat model of MS, experimental autoimmune EAE. Concomitant with the increase in this cell population, there is a significant decrease in the number of autoreactive T cells in the central nervous system. Bone marrow-derived DCs cultivated in the presence of vitamin D3 present a tolerogenic profile with high IL-10, TNF<ce><b1>, and IDO expression and decreased MHC-II and CD80 expression. The adoptive transfer of IDO (+) DCs induces a significant increase in the percentage of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) T cells in the lymph nodes, comparable with vitamin D3 treatment.

Two of the most intriguing findings are the season of birth and childhood sun exposure effects. They both suggest that a vitamin D deficiency during these critical imprinting periods is a risk factor for MS. After having confirmed that people born in November are at lower risk of developing MS, we devised a mouse model of prenatal vitamin D deficiency. We observed that adult offspring born to vitamin D deficient mothers, when compared to control offspring, developed a striking milder and delayed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and permanently overexpressed the vitamin D receptor. This unexpected finding led us to conjecture that the newborns, after having known an in utero vitamin D-deficient environment, were highly sensitive ex utero to cholecalciferol-containing diet and interpreted the postnatal food as a vitamin D enriched environment. To validate this hypothesis, we devised a mouse model of postnatal vitamin D supplementation. Interestingly, using the same EAE model, we demonstrated that a delayed onset and less severe symptoms were displayed by postnatally vitamin D-supplemented mice. The latter finding is in accordance with previous animal studies demonstrating that a postnatal vitamin D deficiency induced an earlier onset and an increased symptom severity of EAE and epidemiological reports describing the importance of an adequate supply of vitamin D during early life.",10.1016/j.jns.2011.08.044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2011.08.044,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,NA,female,12,Vitamin D3,control,3,47,"0,3",1,7,NA,2.5,6,NA,mean,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,prenatal administration of Vitamin D3,Fernandes.de.Abreu_2011_JNS,JOUR,44958,"Animals and Animals, Newborn and Dietary Supplements/*standards and Disease Models, Animal and Female and Humans and Infant, Newborn and Mice and Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/prevention & control and Pregnancy and Risk Factors and *Seasons and Treatment Outcome and Vitamin D/*therapeutic use and Vitamin D Deficiency/*drug therapy/epidemiology/prevention & control",eng,0022-510x,64-8,311,21930286,"Aix-Marseille Univ, NICN, CNRS UMR 6184, 13015 Marseille, France.",NA,NA,NA,NA,45275,NLM,1028,"ASReview_relevant and 1878-5883 and Fernandes de Abreu, Diana A and Landel, V<c3><a9>r<c3><a9>na and F<c3><a9>ron, Fran<c3><a7>ois and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Netherlands and 2011/09/21 and J Neurol Sci. 2011 Dec 15;311(1-2):64-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jns.2011.08.044.

In this study we sought to translate some of our previous findings in murine systems to human in vitro models and delineate the interdependence of these different cytokines in their immunoregulatory effects. We demonstrate that human IL-27 upregulates IL-10 in T cell-activated PBMC cultures and that IFN-<ce><b2> drives IL-27 production in activated monocytes. IFN-<ce><b2>-driven IL-27 is responsible for the upregulation of IL-10, but not IL-17 suppression, by IFN-<ce><b2> in human PBMCs. Surprisingly, IL-10 is not required for the suppression of IL-17 by either IL-27 or IFN-<ce><b2> in this model or in de novo differentiating Th17 cells, nor is IL-27 signaling required for the suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by IFN-<ce><b2> in vivo. Furthermore, and even more surprisingly, IL-10 is not required for the suppression of Th17-biased EAE by IL-27, in sharp contrast to Th1-biased EAE. In conclusion, IFN-<ce><b2> and IL-27 both induce human IL-10, both suppress human Th17 responses, and both suppress murine EAE. However, IL-27 signaling is not required for the therapeutic effect of IFN-<ce><b2> in EAE. Suppression of Th17-biased EAE by IL-27 is IL-10-independent, in contrast to its mechanism of action in Th1-biased EAE. Taken together, these findings delineate a complex set of interdependent and independent immunoregulatory mechanisms of IFN-<ce><b2>, IL-27, and IL-10 in human experimental models and in murine Th1- and Th17-driven autoimmunity.

In vitro, IFN-beta reduced the mRNA levels and protein expression of adhesion molecules of brain endothelial cell cultures and diminished monocyte transendothelial migration.

The drug is phosphorylated in vivo by sphingosine kinase 2 to its bioactive form, FTY720-P. Although treatment with FTY720 is accompanied by a reduction of the peripheral lymphocyte count, its efficacy in MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) may be due to additional, direct effects in the central nervous system (CNS). We now show that FTY720 localizes to the CNS white matter, preferentially along myelin sheaths. Brain trough levels of FTY720 and FTY720-P in rat EAE are of the same magnitude and dose dependently increase; they are in the range of 40 to 540 ng/g in the brain tissue at efficacious doses and exceed blood concentrations severalfold. In a rat model of chronic EAE, prolonged treatment with 0.03 mg/kg was efficacious, but limiting the dosing period failed to prevent EAE despite a significant decrease in blood lymphocytes. FTY720 effectiveness is likely due to a culmination of mechanisms involving reduction of autoreactive T cells, neuroprotective influence of FTY720-P in the CNS, and inhibition of inflammatory mediators in the brain.",10.1124/jpet.107.127183,https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.107.127183,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Dark Agouti,female,NA,Fingolimod,control,1,110,"1,2",0.1,33,0.1,2.7,48,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Foster_2007_JPET,JOUR,2,"Administration, Oral and Animals and Autoradiography and Brain/*metabolism and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism and Female and Fingolimod Hydrochloride and Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacokinetics and Lymphocyte Count and Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy and Phosphorylation and Propylene Glycols/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use and Rats and Rats, Inbred Lew and Sphingosine/administration & dosage/*analogs & and derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use",eng,0022-3565 (Print) 0022-3565,469-75,323,17682127,"Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Vienna, Austria.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Nov,NLM,1315,"ASReview_relevant and Foster, Carolyn A and Howard, Laurence M and Schweitzer, Alain and Persohn, Elke and Hiestand, Peter C and Balatoni, Bal<c3><a1>zs and Reuschel, Roland and Beerli, Christian and Schwartz, Manuela and Billich, Andreas and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2007/08/08 and J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2007 Nov;323(2):469-75. doi: 10.1124/jpet.107.127183.

To further investigate its mode of action, we analyzed gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS) during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). FTY720 downregulated inflammatory genes in addition to vascular adhesion molecules. It decreased the matrix metalloproteinase gene MMP-9 and increased its counterregulator--tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, TIMP-1--resulting in a proteolytic balance that favors preservation of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity. Furthermore, FTY720 reduced S1P lyase that increases the S1P concentration in the brain, in line with a marked reversal of neurological deficits and raising the possibility for enhanced triggering of S1P receptors on resident brain cells. This is accompanied by an increase in S1P(1) and S1P(5) in contrast with the attenuation of S1P(3) and S1P(4). Late-stage rescue therapy with FTY720, even up to 1 month after EAE onset, reversed BBB leakiness and reduced demyelination, along with normalization of neurologic function. Our results indicate rapid blockade of ongoing disease processes by FTY720, and structural restoration of the CNS parenchyma, which is likely caused by the inhibition of autoimmune T cell infiltration and direct modulation of microvascular and/or glial cells.",10.1111/j.1750-3639.2008.00182.x,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3639.2008.00182.x,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Dark Agouti,female,9,Fingolimod,control,1,NA,"1,2",0,6,0,2.6,6,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Foster_2009_BraiPath,JOUR,2,"Animals and Antigens/administration & dosage and Blood-Brain Barrier/drug effects/*pathology/physiopathology and Blotting, Western and Brain/*metabolism/pathology and Capillary Permeability/drug effects and Demyelinating Diseases/drug therapy and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug and therapy/genetics/pathology/physiopathology and Female and Fingolimod Hydrochloride and Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects and Immunization and Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use and Myelin Proteins/metabolism and Phospholipases A2, Cytosolic/metabolism and Polymerase Chain Reaction and Propylene Glycols/*therapeutic use and Random Allocation and Rats and Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use and Spinal Cord/*metabolism/pathology",eng,1015-6305 (Print) 1015-6305,254-66,19,18540945,"Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Brunner Strasse 59, Vienna, Austria. carolyn.foster@novartis.com",NA,NA,The authors declare no competing financial interests.,PMC8094834,Apr,NLM,1271,"ASReview_relevant and 1750-3639 and Foster, Carolyn A and Mechtcheriakova, Diana and Storch, Maria K and Balatoni, Bal<c3><a1>zs and Howard, Laurence M and Bornancin, Fr<c3><a9>d<c3><a9>ric and Wlachos, Alexander and Sobanov, Jury and Kinnunen, Anu and Baumruker, Thomas and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Switzerland and 2008/06/11 and Brain Pathol. 2009 Apr;19(2):254-66. doi: 10.1111/j.1750-3639.2008.00182.x.

We investigated the efficacy and mechanism of immunosuppression against EAE by administering 2-amino-[2-(4-octylphenyl) ethyl]-1,3-propanediol hydrochloride (FTY720) in Lewis rats immunized with myelin basic protein together with complete Freund's adjuvant. FTY720 treatment almost completely protected the rats against disease. The protection by FTY720 was associated with a dramatic reduction in the number of lymphocytes staining for T-cell receptors in the spinal cord as examined by immunohistochemistry. The mRNA expression of Th1 cytokines interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, and interferon-gamma in the spinal cord was also reduced dramatically as assessed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, lymphocytes isolated from the spleen of FTY720-treated rats were transferred into naive recipient rats against EAE manifestation by reducing both disease incidence and clinical score. These results suggested that the protective anti-inflammatory effect of treatment with FTY720 was, to a large extent, due to the inhibition of encephalitogenic T-cell responses and/or their migration into the central nervous system and may be a potential candidate for use in treating patients with MS.",10.1124/jpet.102.045658,https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.102.045658,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,male,10,Fingolimod,control,1,51,1,0,23,0,2.9,16,0.6,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Fujino_2003_JPET,JOUR,1,"Animals and *Apoptosis and Central Nervous System/cytology/drug effects and Central Nervous System Diseases/drug therapy and Cytokines/metabolism and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/prevention & control and Fingolimod Hydrochloride and Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use and Male and Propylene Glycols/*therapeutic use and Rats and Rats, Inbred Lew and Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives and T-Lymphocytes/drug effects",eng,0022-3565 (Print) 0022-3565,70-7,305,12649354,"Laboratory of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Innovative Surgery, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Apr,NLM,1516,"ASReview_relevant and Fujino, Masayuki and Funeshima, Naoko and Kitazawa, Yusuke and Kimura, Hiromitsu and Amemiya, Hiroshi and Suzuki, Seiichi and Li, Xiao-Kang and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2003/03/22 and J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2003 Apr;305(1):70-7. doi: 10.1124/jpet.102.045658.",Amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats by FTY720 treatment,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Marketed,NA,131

Pharmacological modulation of voltage-sensitive potassium channels (K(V)) has been found to improve conduction in experimentally induced demyelination and produces symptomatic improvement in MS patients. Here we used an animal model of autoimmune inflammatory neurodegeneration, namely experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), to test the influence of the K(V)-inhibitor 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) on various disease and immune parameters as well as mobility in MOG<e2><82><83><e2><82><85><e2><82><8b><e2><82><85><e2><82><85> immunized C57Bl/6 mice. We challenged the hypothesis that 4-AP exerts relevant immunomodulatory or neuroprotective properties. Neither prophylactic nor therapeutic treatment with 4-AP altered disease incidence or disease course of EAE. Histopathological signs of demyelination and neuronal damage as well as MRI imaging of brain volume changes were unaltered. While application of 4-AP significantly reduced the standing outward current of stimulated CD4(+) T cells compared to controls, it failed to impact intracellular calcium concentrations in these cells. Compatibly, KV channel inhibition neither influenced CD4(+) T cell effector functions (proliferation, IL17 or IFN<ce><b3> production). Importantly however, despite equal disease severity scores 4-AP treated animals showed improved mobility as assessed by 2 independent methods, 1) foot print and 2) rotarod analysis (0.332 <c2><b1> 0.03, n=7 versus 0.399 <c2><b1> 0.08, n=14, p<0.001, respectively). Our data suggest that 4-AP while having no apparent immunomodulatory or direct neuroprotective effects, significantly ameliorates conduction abnormalities thereby improving gait and coordination. Improvement of mobility in this experimental model supports trial data and clinical experience with 4-AP in the symptomatic treatment of MS.",10.1016/j.expneurol.2013.05.016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.expneurol.2013.05.016,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,11,Fampridine,control,1,NA,"1,2",3.5,NA,0.2,4.2,NA,0.2,"mean, SEM",3.1,NA,0.5,3.2,NA,0.6,"mean, SEM",brain volume,NA,G.U.00C3..U.00B6.bel_2013_ExpNeu,JOUR,NA,"4-Aminopyridine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Animals and Brain/*drug effects/pathology and CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology and Cell Proliferation/drug effects and Disease Progression and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology and Female and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Motor Activity/*drug effects and Myelin Sheath/drug effects/pathology and Nerve Fibers, Myelinated/*drug effects/pathology and Neurons/drug effects/pathology and Potassium Channel Blockers/pharmacology/therapeutic use and Treatment Outcome and 4-Aminopyridine and Eae and Mobility and Multiple sclerosis and Symptomatic treatment",eng,0014-4886,62-71,248,23748135,"University of Muenster, Department of Neurology, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, 48149 Muenster, Germany.

Hence, this relates to replacement of lost oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths-the primary targets of autoimmune attacks. Endogenous remyelination is mainly mediated via activation and differentiation of resident oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPCs), whereas its efficiency remains limited and declines with disease progression and aging. Teriflunomide has been approved as a first-line treatment for relapsing remitting MS. Beyond its role in acting via inhibition of de novo pyrimidine synthesis leading to a cytostatic effect on proliferating lymphocyte subsets, this study aims to uncover its potential to foster myelin repair. METHODS: Within the cuprizone mediated de-/remyelination model teriflunomide dependent effects on oligodendroglial homeostasis and maturation, related to cellular processes important for myelin repair were analyzed in vivo. Teriflunomide administration was performed either as pulse or continuously and markers specific for oligodendroglial maturation and mitochondrial integrity were examined by means of gene expression and immunohistochemical analyses. In addition, axon myelination was determined using electron microscopy. RESULTS: Both pulse and constant teriflunomide treatment efficiently boosted myelin repair activities in this model, leading to accelerated generation of oligodendrocytes and restoration of myelin sheaths. Moreover, teriflunomide restored mitochondrial integrity within oligodendroglial cells. CONCLUSIONS: The link between de novo pyrimidine synthesis inhibition, oligodendroglial rescue, and maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis appears as a key for successful myelin repair and hence for protection of axons from degeneration.",10.1186/s12974-022-02686-6,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-022-02686-6,PH,1,NA,cuprizone,mouse,C57BL/6,female,8,Teriflunomide,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,G.U.00C3..U.00B6.ttle_2023_JN,JOUR,1,*Myelin Sheath/metabolism and *Oligodendroglia/metabolism and Crotonates/pharmacology/therapeutic use and Hydroxybutyrates/metabolism/pharmacology and Cell Differentiation and Multiple sclerosis and Neuroregeneration and Oligodendrocyte and Remyelination and Teriflunomide,eng,1742-2094,7,20,36611185,"Department of Neurology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University, Moorenstrasse 5, 40225, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.

To study the efficacy of release-active forms of antibody to S100 protein in an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Materials and methods. The study was performed on 60 female rats aged 12 weeks. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis was induced by administration of spinal cord homogenate at the base of the tail. Female rats then received intragastric solution of release-active antibodies to S100 protein (Tenoten) at a dose of 2.5 ml/kg/day or distilled water for 30 days.

F.",2008,NeuroImmunoModulation,Steroid protection in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of multiple sclerosis,"Objectives: Based on evidence that pregnant women with multiple sclerosis (MS) show a decline in the relapse rate during the third trimester and an increase during the first 3 months postpartum, the suggestion was made that high levels of circulating sex steroids are responsible for pregnancy-mediated neuroprotection. As both estradiol (E2) and progesterone exert neuroprotective and myelinating effects on the nervous system, the effects of sex steroids were studied in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. Methods: EAE was induced in female C57BL/6 mice by administration of a myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG40-45) peptide. Clinical signs of EAE, myelin protein expression and neuronal parameters were determined in mice with or without hormonal treatment. Results: Progesterone given prior to EAE induction attenuated the clinical scores of the disease, slightly delayed disease onset and decreased demyelination foci, according to luxol fast blue staining (LFB), myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP) and mRNA expression. Motoneuron expression of Na,K-ATPase mRNA was also enhanced by progesterone. In turn, combined E2 plus progesterone therapy more effectively prevented neurological deficits, fully restored LFB staining, MBP and PLP immunoreactivity and avoided inflammatory cell infiltration. On the neuronal side, steroid biotherapy increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA. Conclusion: Early treatment with progesterone alone or more evidently in combination with E2 showed a clinical benefit and produced myelinating and neuroprotective effects in mice with MOG 40-45-induced EAE. Therefore, sex steroids should be considered as potential novel therapeutic strategies for MS. Copyright <c2><a9> 2008 S.

The investigation of iNOS expression during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) of the Lewis rat demonstrated iNOS immunoreactivity and mRNA both during inflammatory bursts (days 12 and 23 post-immunization) and during the remission phase (day 18). iNOS expression was region-specific and expanded with time along a caudo-rostral axis, thus, correlating with the development of inflammatory infiltrates. Whereas cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage continuously contributed to iNOS expression, astrocytes only expressed iNOS immunoreactivity or mRNA during the relapse (day 23). In order to investigate possible regulatory effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3) on iNOS expression, rats were treated with the hormone after the beginning of clinical signs (days 11, 13, 19, 21 and 23 post-immunization), and areas of the CNS were examined at day 23. 1,25-D3 exerted a drastic inhibitory effect on iNOS expression, both at the protein and the mRNA levels. However, this effect was region-specific, and was most pronounced in the cerebellum and brainstem, but non-existent in cerebral cortex. iNOS down-regulation occurred in macrophages, activated microglia and astrocytes. The inhibition of iNOS expression in some CNS structures could account for the improvement of clinical signs observed in EAE-rats treated with 1,25-D3. Since 1,25-D3 can be synthesized by activated macrophages or microglia, our results support the hypothesis that this hormone might be implicated in the control of the CNS-specific immune responses. 1,25-D3 or its analogues could, thus, be of therapeutic value in the management of iNOS-associated diseases of the CNS.",10.1016/S0169-328X(96)00260-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-328X(96)00260-4,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,female,8.5,Vitamin D3,control,1,37,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Garcion_1997_MoleBraiRese,JOUR,2,calcitriol and messenger RNA and nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase and autoimmune encephalomyelitis and animal experiment and animal model and article and astrocyte and brain cortex and brain region and brain stem and central nervous system and cerebellum and controlled study and female and gene expression regulation and gene induction and immune response and immunoreactivity and intraperitoneal drug administration and macrophage and monocyte and nonhuman and priority journal and protein expression and rat,English,0169-328X,255-267,45,NA,"P.

In an acute mouse model of autoimmune retinal disease, we demonstrate that treatment with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, suppresses clinical ocular pathology, retinal vascular leakage, and leukocytic infiltration into the retina. Efficacy was reversed by coadministration of mevalonolactone, the downstream product of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, but not by squalene, which is distal to isoprenoid pyrophosphate metabolites within the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Lovastatin treatment (20 mg/kg/day i.p.) over 7 days, which resulted in plasma lovastatin hydroxyacid concentrations of 0.098 <c2><b1> 0.03 <ce><bc>M, did not induce splenocyte Th2 cytokine production but did cause a small reduction in Ag-induced T cell proliferation and a decrease in the production of IFN-<ce><b3> and IL-10. Thus, it is possible to dissociate the therapeutic effect of statins in experimental autoimmune uveitic mice from their activity on the Th1/Th2 balance. Statins inhibit isoprenoid pyrophosphate synthesis, precursors required for the prenylation and posttranslational activation of Rho GTPase, a key molecule in the endothelial ICAM-1-mediated pathway that facilitates lymphocyte migration. Consistent with inhibition of leukocyte infiltration in vivo, lovastatin treatment of retinal endothelial cell monolayers in vitro leads to inhibition of lymphocyte transmigration, which may, in part, account for drug efficacy. Unlike lovastatin, atorvastatin treatment showed little efficacy in retinal inflammatory disease despite showing significant clinical benefit in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. These data highlight the potential differential activity of statins in different inflammatory conditions and their possible therapeutic use for the treatment of human posterior uveitis.",10.4049/jimmunol.174.4.2327,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.174.4.2327,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,10,Atorvastatin,control,1,NA,"1,2",0.5,6,0.4,3.1,6,0.5,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Gegg_2005_JoofIm,JOUR,4,atorvastatin and cholesterol and cytokine and gamma interferon and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and interleukin 10 and isoprenoid phosphate and mevalonolactone and mevinolin and pyrophosphate and Rho guanine nucleotide binding protein and squalene and autoimmune encephalomyelitis and animal cell and animal experiment and animal model and article and autoimmune disease and cell infiltration and controlled study and cytokine production and drug activity and drug antagonism and drug blood level and drug inhibition and endothelium cell and in vitro study and in vivo study and leukocyte and lymphocyte migration and lymphocyte proliferation and metabolite and mouse and nonhuman and pathology and prenylation and priority journal and retina blood vessel and retina disease and retinitis and spleen cell and T lymphocyte and Th1 cell and Th2 cell and treatment outcome and uveitis,English,0022-1767,2327-2335,174,NA,"J.

This synaptopathy is characterized by an imbalance between glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission and has been proposed to be a potential therapeutic target. Siponimod (BAF312), a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate1,5 receptor modulator, is currently under investigation in a clinical trial in secondary progressive MS patients. We investigated whether siponimod, in addition to its peripheral immune modulation, may exert direct neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice with chronic progressive EAE. METHODS: Minipumps allowing continuous intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of siponimod for 4<c2><a0>weeks were implanted into C57BL/6 mice subjected to MOG35-55-induced EAE. Electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, western blot, qPCR experiments, and peripheral lymphocyte counts were performed. In addition, the effect of siponimod on activated microglia was assessed in vitro to confirm the direct effect of the drug on CNS-resident immune cells. RESULTS: Siponimod administration (0.45<c2><a0><ce><bc>g/day) induced a significant beneficial effect on EAE clinical scores with minimal effect on peripheral lymphocyte counts. Siponimod rescued defective GABAergic transmission in the striatum of EAE, without correcting the EAE-induced alterations of glutamatergic transmission. We observed a significant attenuation of astrogliosis and microgliosis together with reduced lymphocyte infiltration in the striatum of EAE mice treated with siponimod. Interestingly, siponimod reduced the release of IL-6 and RANTES from activated microglial cells in vitro, which might explain the reduced lymphocyte infiltration. Furthermore, the loss of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) GABAergic interneurons typical of EAE brains was rescued by siponimod treatment, providing a plausible explanation of the selective effects of this drug on inhibitory synaptic transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our results show that siponimod has neuroprotective effects in the CNS of EAE mice, which are likely independent of its peripheral immune effect, suggesting that this drug could be effective in limiting neurodegenerative pathological processes in MS.",10.1186/s12974-016-0686-4,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-016-0686-4,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,NA,NA,Siponimod,control,1,NA,0,0,6,0,2.3,9,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Gentile_2016_JN,JOUR,1,"Animals and Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism and Azetidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Benzyl Compounds/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism and Cell Line, Transformed and Cerebral Cortex/cytology and Cytokines/pharmacology and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/chemically induced/*complications and Freund's Adjuvant/immunology/toxicity and Mice and Microfilament Proteins/genetics/metabolism and Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein/immunology/toxicity and *Nerve Degeneration/etiology/pathology/prevention & control and Neural Conduction/drug effects/physiology and Neuroglia/drug effects/metabolism and Neurons/drug effects and Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Peptide Fragments/immunology/toxicity and Synapses/drug effects/*physiology and Synaptic Potentials/drug effects and T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology and White Matter/drug effects/pathology and Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and Gaba and Neurodegeneration and Parvalbumin neuron and Striatum and Synaptic transmission",eng,1742-2094,207,13,27566665,"Laboratory of Neuroimmunology and Synaptic Transmission, IRCCS Fondazione Santa Lucia, Centro Europeo di Ricerca sul Cervello (CERC), 00143, Rome, Italy.

GA treatment was able to reverse the tumor necrosis factor-<ce><b1> (TNF-<ce><b1>)-induced alterations of striatal glutamate-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) of EAE mice. Incubation of striatal slices of control animals with lymphocytes taken from EAE mice treated with GA failed to replicate such an anti-glutamatergic effect, while activated microglial cells stimulated with GA in vitro mimicked the effect of GA treatment of EAE mice. Consistently, EAE mice treated with GA had less microglial activation and less TNF-<ce><b1> expression than untreated EAE animals. Furthermore, direct application of GA to EAE slices replicated the in vivo protective activity of GA. Our results show that GA is neuroprotective against glutamate toxicity independently of its peripheral immunodulatory action, and through direct modulation of microglial activation and TNF-<ce><b1> release in the grey matter of EAE and possibly of MS brains.",10.1007/s11481-013-9436-x,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11481-013-9436-x,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Gentile_2013_JNP,JOUR,3,"Animals and Cells, Cultured and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*pathology/*prevention & control and Female and Glatiramer Acetate and Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Peptides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Synapses/drug effects/*pathology",eng,1557-1890,651-63,8,23370991,"Fondazione Santa Lucia/Centro Europeo per la Ricerca sul Cervello, Via del Fosso di Fiorano 64, 00143 Rome, Italy.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Jun,NLM,931,"ASReview_relevant and 1557-1904 and Gentile, Antonietta and Rossi, Silvia and Studer, Valeria and Motta, Caterina and De Chiara, Valentina and Musella, Alessandra and Sepman, Helena and Fresegna, Diego and Musumeci, Gabriele and Grasselli, Giorgio and Haji, Nabila and Weiss, Sagit and Hayardeny, Liat and Mandolesi, Georgia and Centonze, Diego and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2013/02/02 and J Neuroimmune Pharmacol. 2013 Jun;8(3):651-63. doi: 10.1007/s11481-013-9436-x.

S1P1 receptors are essential for lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes and a drug target in immune-mediated diseases. Here, we have characterized the immunomodulatory potential of BAF312 and the S1P receptor-mediated effects on heart rate using preclinical and human data. Experimental approach: BAF312 was tested in a rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Electrophysiological recordings of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels were carried out in human atrial myocytes. A Phase I multiple-dose trial studied the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of BAF312 in 48 healthy subjects. KEY RESULTS BAF312 effectively suppressed EAE in rats by internalizing S1P 1 receptors, rendering them insensitive to the egress signal from lymph nodes. In healthy volunteers, BAF312 caused preferential decreases in CD4+ T cells, Tna<c3><af>ve, Tcentral memory and B cells within 4-6 h. Cell counts returned to normal ranges within a week after stopping treatment, in line with the elimination half-life of BAF312. Despite sparing S1P3 receptors (associated with bradycardia in mice), BAF312 induced rapid, transient (day 1 only) bradycardia in humans. BAF312-mediated activation of GIRK channels in human atrial myocytes can fully explain the bradycardia. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS This study illustrates species-specific differences in S1P receptor specificity for first-dose cardiac effects. Based on its profound but rapidly reversible inhibition of lymphocyte trafficking, BAF312 may have potential as a treatment for immune-mediated diseases. <c2><a9> 2012 The British Pharmacological Society.",10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.02061.x,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.02061.x,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Dark Agouti,NA,9,Siponimod,control,1,48,2,0.3,9,0.2,2.7,12,0.2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"all the other data is given in mean, but there are sd and sem values in the paper- bradycardia reported in humans, although the drug sparing S1P3 receptor which is associated with bradycardia in mice",Gergely_2012_BrJoofPh,JOUR,5,1 [4 [1 (4 cyclohexyl 3 trifluoromethylbenzyloxyimino)ethyl] 2 ethylbenzyl]azetidine 3 carboxylic acid and alanine aminotransferase and siponimod and G protein coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channel and immunomodulating agent and placebo and sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor and unclassified drug and alanine aminotransferase blood level and autoimmune encephalomyelitis and animal cell and area under the curve and article and B lymphocyte and bradycardia and bronchospasm and CD4+ T lymphocyte and cellular distribution and cohort analysis and connective tissue disease and controlled study and dizziness and dose response and double blind procedure and drug accumulation and drug blood level and drug dose reduction and drug elimination and drug half life and drug induced headache and drug safety and drug tolerability and dyspnea and gastrointestinal disease and heart atrium and heart electrophysiology and cardiac muscle cell and heart muscle conduction disturbance and human and human cell and human experiment and human tissue and internalization (cell) and laboratory test and lung function test and lymph node and lymphocyte count and lymphocyte migration and maximum plasma concentration and memory T lymphocyte and musculoskeletal disease and neurologic disease and nonhuman and normal human and parallel design and phase 1 clinical trial and priority journal and protein transport and randomized controlled trial and rat and receptor blocking and macular edema and second degree atrioventricular block and side effect and signal transduction and time to maximum plasma concentration and visual acuity and volunteer and baf 312,English,0007-1188 1476-5381,1035-1047,167,NA,"P.

The lipophilicity and low molecular weight of FTY720 allows it to cross blood brain barrier (BBB) and exert both peripheral and central effects. Previous reports showed that intranasal (IN) administration of drugs are the preferred non-invasive route, which bypasses BBB and improves their delivery and bioavailability in the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, we aimed to compare the effects of IN and oral administrations of FTY720 on astrocyte activation and demyelination levels of optic chiasm in a focal demyelination model. METHODS: The experimental model was induced by injection of 2 <c2><b5>L lysolecithin 1% into the optic chiasm of male Wistar rats. The rats were treated by oral gavage or intranasal drop of FTY720 at dose of 0.3<c2><a0>mg/kg for 14 days. Astrocyte activation was analyzed using GFAP immunostaining, extent of demyelination, and myelination levels were measured by fluoromyelin staining, and MOG immunostaining, respectively. Then, the concentration of FTY720 was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method in brain tissues. RESULTS: Our data showed that IN administration of FTY720 significantly decreases astrocyte activation and demyelination levels in the optic chiasm compared to the oral administration route. In addition, the concentration of FTY720 was higher in the brain tissue of IN receiving rats compared to the oral treated group. CONCLUSION: It seems that IN administration of FTY720 may be a preferred route to decline the central inflammation and demyelination levels in the MS patients.",10.1016/j.msard.2022.103518,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2022.103518,PH,1,NA,lysolecithin,rat,Wistar,male,NA,Fingolimod,control,1,30,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ghasemi.Kasman_2022_MultScleRelaDiso,JOUR,NA,"Administration, Intranasal and Animals and *Demyelinating Diseases/chemically induced/drug therapy and Disease Models, Animal and *Fingolimod Hydrochloride/therapeutic use and Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use and Lysophosphatidylcholines/adverse effects and Male and Optic Chiasm and Rats and Rats, Wistar and Astrocyte activation and Demyelination and Fingolimod and Intranasal administration and Myelination",eng,2211-0348,103518,59,35086052,"Cellular and Molecular Biology Research Center, Health Research Institute, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran; Neuroscience Research Center, Health Research Institute, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran.

Currently, it is uncertain whether one or both of these properties may explain teriflunomide's beneficial effect in MS. Thus, to learn more about its mechanisms of action, we evaluated the effect of teriflunomide in the Theiler's encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) model, which is both a viral infection and an excellent model of the progressive disability of MS. We assessed the effects of the treatment on central nervous system (CNS) viral load, intrathecal immune response, and progressive neurological disability in mice intracranially infected with TMEV. In the TMEV-IDD model, we showed that teriflunomide has both anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, but there seemed to be no impact on disability progression and intrathecal antibody production. Notably, benefits in TMEV-IDD were mostly mediated by effects on various cytokines produced in the CNS.

Levels of MMP-9 are elevated in multiple sclerosis (MS) and predict the occurrence of new active lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This translational study aims to determine whether in vivo treatment with the pregnancy hormone estriol affects MMP-9 levels from immune cells in patients with MS and mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from three female MS patients treated with estriol and splenocytes from EAE mice treated with estriol, estrogen receptor (ER) alpha ligand, ERbeta ligand or vehicle were stimulated ex vivo and analyzed for levels of MMP-9. Markers of CNS infiltration were assessed using MRI in patients and immunohistochemistry in mice. Supernatants from PBMCs obtained during estriol treatment in female MS patients showed significantly decreased MMP-9 compared with pretreatment. Decreases in MMP-9 coincided with a decrease in enhancing lesion volume on MRI. Estriol treatment of mice with EAE reduced MMP-9 in supernatants from autoantigen-stimulated splenocytes, coinciding with decreased CNS infiltration by T cells and monocytes. Experiments with selective ER ligands showed that this effect was mediated through ERalpha. In conclusion, estriol acting through ERalpha to reduce MMP-9 from immune cells is one mechanism potentially underlying the estriol-mediated reduction in enhancing lesions in MS and inflammatory lesions in EAE.",10.1038/labinvest.2009.79,https://doi.org/10.1038/labinvest.2009.79,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,8,Estriol,control,1,NA,0,0,5,0,3.2,5,0.2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Gold_2009_LabInv,JOUR,10,"Animals and Cells, Cultured and Down-Regulation and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism and Estriol/*therapeutic use and Estrogen Receptor alpha/*metabolism and Estrogen Receptor beta/metabolism and Female and Humans and Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism and Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism and Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*metabolism and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/*drug therapy/metabolism and Pregnancy and Spleen/cytology",eng,0023-6837 (Print) 0023-6837,1076-83,89,19668239,"Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.",NA,NA,NA,PMC2753699,Oct,NLM,1196,"ASReview_relevant and 1530-0307 and Gold, Stefan M and Sasidhar, Manda V and Morales, Laurie B and Du, Sienmi and Sicotte, Nancy L and Tiwari-Woodruff, Seema K and Voskuhl, Rhonda R and R01 AI050839/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and R01 NS045443-04/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and P41 RR013642-116752/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States and K24 NS062117-02/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and P41 RR013642/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States and R01 AI050839-08/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and R01 NS051591/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and K24 NS062117/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and R01 NS45443/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and R01 NS051591-03/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and R01 NS045443/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2009/08/12 and Lab Invest. 2009 Oct;89(10):1076-83. doi: 10.1038/labinvest.2009.79.

This study aims to analyze neurogenesis in a model of toxic demyelination in order to evaluate the effects of VitD on demyelination and remyelination. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used 24 male Wistar rats that had received surgical lesions to the corpus callosum and were injected with lysolecithin. Rats were divided into three groups: Group 1 included eight rats with lesions to the corpus callosum but not lysolecithin injections (sham group), group 2 included eight rats with lesions to the corpus callosum that were injected with lysolecithin (lysolecithin group), and group 3 included eight rats with lesions that were injected with lysolecithin and received VitD (VitD group). We analyzed neurogenesis both in the subventricular zone and at the lesion site. RESULTS: Administration of VitD promotes the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and the migration of these cells to the lesion site in the corpus callosum; these cells subsequently differentiate into oligodendrocyte lineage cells and produce myelin basic protein. This phenomenon was not caused by microglial activation, which was less marked in rats receiving VitD. Megalin expression did not increase at the lesion site, which suggests that VitD is internalized by other mechanisms. CONCLUSION: Our results support the hypothesis that regardless of the presence of VitD deficiency, treatment with VitD may contribute to remyelination by promoting the proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells.",10.1002/brb3.1498,https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1498,PH,1,NA,lysolecithin,rat,Wistar,male,14,Vitamin D3,control,1,24,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Gomez.Pinedo_2020_BraiBeha,JOUR,1,"Animals and Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology and Cell Lineage/drug effects and Male and Multiple Sclerosis/therapy and Neural Stem Cells/physiology and Oligodendroglia/*physiology and Rats and Rats, Wistar and *Remyelination/drug effects/physiology and Treatment Outcome and *Vitamin D/metabolism/pharmacology and Vitamins/metabolism/pharmacology and lysolecithin and multiple sclerosis and neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis and remyelination and vitamin D",eng,NA,e01498,10,31837111,"Neurobiology Laboratory, Department of Neurology, Institute of Neurosciences, IdISSC, Hospital ClÃ­nico San Carlos, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",NA,NA,None declared.,PMC6955836,Jan,NLM,295,"ASReview_relevant and 2162-3279 and Gomez-Pinedo, Ulises and Orcid: 0000-0003-3097-5557 and Cuevas, Jes<c3><ba>s Adriel and Benito-Mart<c3><ad>n, Mar<c3><ad>a Soledad and Moreno-Jim<c3><a9>nez, Lidia and Esteban-Garcia, Noelia and Torre-Fuentes, Laura and Orcid: 0000-0003-4878-584x and Mat<c3><ad>as-Guiu, Jordi A and Orcid: 0000-0001-5520-2708 and Pytel, Vanesa and Orcid: 0000-0002-2518-338x and Montero, Paloma and Mat<c3><ad>as-Guiu, Jorge and Orcid: 0000-0001-8162-9043 and Journal Article and United States and 2019/12/15 and Brain Behav. 2020 Jan;10(1):e01498. doi: 10.1002/brb3.1498.

Interferon (IFN)-<ce><b2> constitutes one of the first-line therapies to treat MS, but has limited efficacy due to the injectable systemic administration, short half-life, and limited CNS access. To address these limitations, we developed IFN-<ce><b2>-loaded chitosan/sulfobutylether-<ce><b2>-cyclodextrin nanoparticles (IFN-<ce><b2>-NPs) for delivery of IFN-<ce><b2> into the CNS via the intranasal (i.n.) route. The nanoparticles (NPs) (<e2><89><88>200<e2><80><af>nm, polydispersity <e2><89><88>0.1, and zeta potential <e2><89><88>20<e2><80><af>mV) were prepared by mixing two aqueous solutions and associated human or murine IFN-<ce><b2> with high efficiency (90%). Functional in vitro assays showed that IFN-<ce><b2>-NPs were safe and that IFN-<ce><b2> was steadily released while retaining biological activity. Biodistribution analysis showed an early and high fluorescence in the brain after nasal administration of fluorescent probe-loaded NPs. Remarkably, mice developing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an experimental model of MS, exhibited a significant improvement of clinical symptoms in response to intranasal IFN-<ce><b2>-NPs (inIFN-<ce><b2>-NPs), whereas a similar dose of intranasal or systemic free IFN-<ce><b2> had no effect. Importantly, inIFN-<ce><b2>-NPs treatment was equally effective despite a reduction of 78% in the total amount of weekly administered IFN-<ce><b2>. Spinal cords obtained from inIFN-<ce><b2>-NPs-treated EAE mice showed fewer inflammatory foci and demyelination, lower expression of antigen-presenting and costimulatory proteins on CD11b(+) cells, and lower astrocyte and microglia activation than control mice. Therefore, IFN-<ce><b2> treatment at tested doses was effective in promoting clinical recovery and control of neuroinflammation in EAE only when associated with NPs.

Fingolimod, a nonselective sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist that induces sustained lymphopenia and accumulates in the CNS, represents a new treatment modality for MS. We hypothesized that sustained lymphopenia would not be required for efficacy and that a selective, CNS-penetrant, peripherally short-acting, S1P(1) agonist would show full efficacy in a mouse MS model. Using daily treatment with 10 mg/kg 2-(4-(5-(3,4-diethoxyphenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-yl amino)ethanol (CYM-5442) at the onset of clinical signs in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein MOG(35-55)- induced experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), we assessed clinical scores, CNS cellular infiltration, demyelination, and gliosis for 12 days with CYM-5442, vehicle, or fingolimod. CYM-5442 levels in CNS and plasma were determined at experiment termination, and blood lymphopenia was measured 3 and 24 h after the last injection. Plasma levels of cytokines were assayed at the end of the protocol. Changes in S1P(1)-enhanced green fluorescent protein expression on neurons and astrocytes during active EAE and upon CYM-5442 treatment were quantified with flow cytometry and Western blotting by using native-locus enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged S1P(1) mice. S1P(1) agonism alone reduced pathological features as did fingolimod (maximally lymphopenic throughout), despite full reversal of lymphopenia within each dosing interval. CYM-5442 levels in CNS but not in plasma were sustained. Neuronal and astrocytic S1P(1) expression in EAE was suppressed by CYM-5442 treatment, relative to vehicle, and levels of key cytokines, such as interleukin 17A, were also significantly reduced in drug-treated mice.

Across a range of experimental models, LINGO-1 has been found to inhibit neuron and oligodendrocyte survival, axon regeneration, and (re)myelination. The therapeutic effects of anti-LINGO-1 antibodies on optic nerve axonal loss and regeneration have not yet been investigated. OBJECTIVE: In this series of studies we investigate if LINGO-1 antibodies can prevent acute inflammatory axonal loss, and promote axonal regeneration after injury in rodent optic nerves. METHODS: The effects of anti-LINGO-1 antibody on optic nerve axonal damage were assessed using rodent myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and its effects on axonal regeneration were assessed in optic nerve crush injury models. RESULTS: In the optic nerve, anti-LINGO-1 antibody therapy was associated with improved optic nerve parallel diffusivity measures on MRI in mice with EAE and reduced axonal loss in rat EAE. Both anti-LINGO-1 antibody therapy and the genetic deletion of LINGO-1 reduced nerve crush-induced axonal degeneration and enhanced axonal regeneration.

MS risk is associated with vitamin D deficiency, and its bioactive form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], has been shown to prevent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of MS, via an incompletely understood mechanism. Herein, we systematically examined 1,25(OH)2D3 effects on TH cells during their migration from the lymph nodes to the CNS. Our data demonstrate that myelin-reactive TH cells are successfully generated in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3, secrete proinflammatory cytokines, and do not preferentially differentiate into suppressor T cells. These cells are able to leave the lymph node, enter the peripheral circulation, and migrate to the s.c. immunization sites. However, TH cells from 1,25(OH)2D3-treated mice are unable to enter the CNS parenchyma but are instead maintained in the periphery. Upon treatment cessation, mice rapidly develop experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, demonstrating that 1,25(OH)2D3 prevents the disease only temporarily likely by halting TH cell migration into the CNS.",10.1073/pnas.1306072110,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1306072110,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,11,Vitamin D3,control,3,NA,1,0,8,0,3.5,8,0.7,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Grishkan_2013_PNASUSA,JOUR,52,"Animals and Calcitriol/*pharmacology and Cell Movement/*drug effects/immunology and Central Nervous System/*immunology and Cytokines/metabolism and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*immunology/prevention & control and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and Luminescent Measurements and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Multiple Sclerosis/*immunology and Statistics, Nonparametric and T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism",eng,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424,21101-6,110,24324134,"Department of Neurology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287.",NA,NA,The authors declare no conflict of interest.,PMC3876241,45284,NLM,860,"ASReview_relevant and 1091-6490 and Grishkan, Inna V and Fairchild, Amanda N and Calabresi, Peter A and Gocke, Anne R and R01 NS041435/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2013/12/11 and Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Dec 24;110(52):21101-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1306072110.

Here, we identify an in vivo astrocyte subpopulation termed immediate-early astrocytes (ieAstrocytes) that is defined by functional c-Fos activation during CNS disease development. An unbiased screen for CNS cells showing c-Fos activation during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), was developed by using inducible, TetTag c-Fos reporter mice that label activated cells with a temporally stable, nuclear green fluorescent protein (GFP). Four-dimensional (3D over time) c-Fos activation maps in the spinal cord were produced by combining tissue clearing (iDISCO) and confocal microscopy that identified onset and expansion of GFP(+) cell populations during EAE. More than 95% of the GFP(+) cells showed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity-in contrast to absent or rare labeling of neurons, microglia, and infiltrating immune cells-which constituted ieAstrocytes that linearly increased in number with progression of EAE. ieAstrocyte formation was reduced by either astrocyte-specific genetic removal of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P(1)) or pharmacological inhibition by fingolimod (FTY720), an FDA-approved MS medicine that can functionally antagonize S1P(1). ieAstrocytes thus represent a functionally defined subset of disease-linked astrocytes that are the first and predominant CNS cell population activated during EAE, and that track with disease severity in vivo. Their reduction by a disease-modifying agent supports their therapeutic relevance to MS and potentially other neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.",10.1523/eneuro.0239-18.2018,https://doi.org/10.1523/eneuro.0239-18.2018,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,NA,female,10,Fingolimod,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Groves_2018_eNeu,JOUR,5,"Animals and Astrocytes/drug effects/*metabolism and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/drug therapy/*metabolism and Female and Fingolimod Hydrochloride/pharmacology and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism and Lysophospholipids/metabolism and Mice and Microglia/metabolism and Multiple Sclerosis/drug therapy/*metabolism and Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/drug effects/*metabolism and Signal Transduction and Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism and Spinal Cord/drug effects/metabolism and Astrocyte and S1p and c-Fos GPCR and lipid mediator and neuroinflammation",eng,2373-2822,NA,5,30255127,"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037.

Ex vivo analyses of MS lesions have revealed cellular heterogeneity and variable T cell levels, which may have important implications for patient stratification and choice of DMT. Although MRI has proven valuable to monitor DMT efficacy, its lack of specificity for cellular subtypes highlights the need for complementary methods to improve lesion characterization. Here, we evaluated the potential of 2'-deoxy-2'-(18)F-fluoro-9-<ce><b2>-d-arabinofuranosylguanine ((18)F-FAraG) PET imaging to noninvasively assess infiltrating T cells and to provide, in combination with MRI, a novel tool to determine lesion types. Methods: We used a novel MS mouse model that combines cuprizone and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis to reproducibly induce 2 brain inflammatory lesion types, differentiated by their T cell content. (18)F-FAraG PET imaging, T2-weighted MRI, and T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI were performed before disease induction, during demyelination with high levels of innate immune cells, and after T cell infiltration. Fingolimod immunotherapy was used to evaluate the ability of PET and MRI to detect therapy response. Ex vivo immunofluorescence analyses for T cells, microglia/macrophages, myelin, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity were performed to validate the in<c2><a0>vivo findings. Results:(18)F-FAraG signal was significantly increased in the brain and spinal cord at the time point of T cell infiltration. (18)F-FAraG signal from white matter (corpus callosum) and gray matter (cortex, hippocampus) further correlated with T cell density. T2-weighted MRI detected white matter lesions independently of T cells. T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI indicated BBB disruption at the time point of T cell infiltration. Fingolimod treatment prevented motor deficits and decreased T cell and microglia/macrophage levels. In agreement, (18)F-FAraG signal was decreased in the brain and spinal cord of fingolimod-treated mice; T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI revealed intact BBB, whereas T2-weighted MRI findings remained unchanged. Conclusion: The combination of MRI and (18)F-FAraG PET enables detection of inflammatory demyelination and T cell infiltration in an MS mouse model, providing a new way to evaluate lesion heterogeneity during disease progression and after DMT.

The medication for MS is able to delay its progression, but complete recovery is impossible. Recent studies with neural stem cells have promising results in treating as well as to recover the damaged nerves, but research on in vivo model system is limited in this aspect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here we are able to successfully establish an MS mice model by injecting with myelin basic protein and we studied the neural stem cell response in supplement with Vitamin D. RESULTS: Through histology we provide strong evidence that the MS pathogenesis is reverted on response to Vitamin D. We also identified through immunohistochemistry and western blotting that the Vitamin D has the ability to trigger neural stem cells, and thereby it assist in recovery from MS. Further, their roles in preventing as well as delaying the MS development are also proven. The role of Vitamin D has also cross checked with the help of tunnel assay.

Based on these associations, patients with multiple sclerosis are frequently supplemented with the vitamin D precursor cholecalciferol, although it is unclear whether this regimen is of therapeutic benefit. To model consequences of this common practice, mice were fed for more than 3 months with a low, medium or high dose of cholecalciferol, representative of vitamin D deficiency, modest and disproportionally high supplementation, respectively, in patients with multiple sclerosis. Compared to vitamin D-deprived mice, its moderate supplementation reduced the severity of subsequent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which was associated with an expansion of regulatory T cells. Direct exposure of murine or human T cells to vitamin D metabolites inhibited their activation. In contrast, mice with 25-(OH) vitamin D levels above 200 nmol/l developed fulminant experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with massive CNS infiltration of activated myeloid cells, Th1 and Th17 cells. When dissecting this unexpected outcome, we observed that high, but not medium dose vitamin D had caused mild hypercalcaemia, which rendered T cells more prone to pro-inflammatory activation. Exposing murine or human T cells to equivalent calcium concentrations in vitro enhanced its influx, triggering activation, upregulation of pro-inflammatory gene products and enhanced transmigration across a blood<e2><80><93>brain barrier model.

The extent of B cell depletion and kinetics of their recovery in different immune compartments is largely unknown. Here, we studied how anti-CD20 treatment influences B cells in bone marrow, blood, lymph nodes, and spleen in models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Anti-CD20 reduced mature B cells in all compartments examined, although a subpopulation of antigen-experienced B cells persisted in splenic follicles. Upon treatment cessation, CD20(+) B cells simultaneously repopulated in bone marrow and spleen before their reappearance in blood. In EAE induced by native myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), a model in which B cells are activated, B cell recovery was characterized by expansion of mature, differentiated cells containing a high frequency of myelin-reactive B cells with restricted B cell receptor gene diversity. Those B cells served as efficient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for activation of myelin-specific T cells. In MOG peptide-induced EAE, a purely T cell-mediated model that does not require B cells, in contrast, reconstituting B cells exhibited a naive phenotype without efficient APC capacity.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study of blood samples from 20 GA-treated and 18 untreated patients with MS was performed by flow cytometry; 6 GA-treated patients with MS were analyzed longitudinally. GA-mediated effects on B-cell antigen-presenting function were investigated in EAE, or, alternatively, B cells were treated with GA in vitro using vehicle as a control. RESULTS: In MS, GA diminished transitional B-cell and plasmablast frequency, downregulated CD69, CD25, and CD95 expression, and decreased TNF-<ce><b1> production, whereas IL-10 secretion and MHC Class II expression were increased. In EAE, we observed an equivalent dampening of proinflammatory B-cell properties and an enhanced expression of MHC Class II. When used as antigen-presenting cells for activation of naive T cells, GA-treated B cells promoted development of regulatory T cells, whereas proinflammatory T-cell differentiation was diminished.

There is no absolute treatment for MS and the available remedies are called disease modifying therapies (DMTs). Glatiramer acetate (GA) is one of the FDA approved DMTs. Currently, injection-site problems and unfavorable daily injection are the most common milestones in administration of GA. So that, the design of improved drug delivery systems with sustained release profile seem necessary and helpful in order to minimize GA adverse effects and improve patients' compliance. In this study, we have manufactured a novel chitosan-PLGA (poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)) hydrogel-microparticles containing GA by double emulsion method. Hydrogel-microparticles' properties including size, morphology and GA loading were investigated. In-vitro drug release was studied during 30<c2><a0>days. In vivo efficacy of GA-hydrogel-microparticles was evaluated in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as an established animal model for MS. Pathological studies were performed through H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) staining of brain, spine, liver, skin and kidney tissues. Luxol fast blue staining of brain tissue was also done. The obtained results were applied for safety and efficacy evaluations. GA loading and Entrapment efficiency (EE %) of 60% and 95% were achieved, respectively. In- vitro release studies confirms a sustained release profile for GA-hydrogel-microparticles. Mean clinical scores and mean body weights obtained from EAE animal model for GA-hydrogel-microparticles were compared to the outcomes achieved from conventional Iranian brand-generic injection solution of GA (Copamer(<c2><ae>), 20<c2><a0>mg/ml). EAE outcomes and pathological studies confirm similar therapeutic efficacy with longer dosing intervals possibility, improved safety through decreased adverse effects and elimination of site injection reactions for GA-hydrogel-microparticles. Further studies on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics in human volunteers are still required to thoroughly examine different aspects of this newly developed GA- hydrogel-microparticles.",10.1038/s41598-022-26640-x,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-26640-x,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,10.5,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,42,NA,0.5,12,1.1,1.7,12,2.5,mean,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Hadidi_2022_SciRep,JOUR,1,"Animals and Humans and Glatiramer Acetate/therapeutic use and Delayed-Action Preparations/therapeutic use and *Hydrogels/therapeutic use and Iran and Drug Delivery Systems and *Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/drug therapy",eng,2045-2322,22042,12,36543898,"Department of Clinical Research and EM Microscope, Pasteur Institute of Iran (PII), Tehran, Iran. n_hadidi@pasteur.ac.ir.

Administration of anti-EMMPRIN Abs reduces the severity of EAE. Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic with immune-modulatory properties that decreases the severity of EAE; it was recently found to attenuate the conversion from a first demyelinating event to clinically definite MS in a phase III trial. We investigated whether and how minocycline affects the expression of EMMPRIN on T cells in culture and in mice afflicted with EAE. EMMPRIN expression in cultures of mouse splenocytes or human PBMCs was elevated upon polyclonal T cell activation, and this was reduced by minocycline correspondent with decreased P-Akt levels. An established MS medication, IFN-<ce><b2>, also diminished EMMPRIN levels on human cells whereas this was not readily observed for fingolimod or monomethylfumarate. In EAE-afflicted mice, minocycline treatment significantly reduced EMMPRIN levels on splenic lymphocytes at the presymptomatic (day 7) phase, and prevented the development of disease.

To begin to understand what mechanisms might control this outcome, we examined the effect of a murine-CD52-specific mAb on the depletion and repopulation of immune cells in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. We tested whether the tolerance-promoting receptor programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) is required for disease remission post anti-CD52, and found that PD-1-deficient mice with a more severe EAE were nevertheless effectively treated with anti-CD52. Anti-CD52 increased the proportions of newly generated T cells and double-negative (DN) T cells while reducing newly generated B cells; the latter effect being associated with a higher expression of CD52 by these cells. In the longer term, anti-CD52 caused substantial increases in the proportion of newly generated lymphocytes and DN T cells in mice with EAE. Thus, the rapid repopulation of lymphocytes from central lymphoid organs post anti-CD52 may limit further disease.

We have previously reported the generation of an interferon superagonist (dubbed YNS<ce><b1>8) that is built on the backbone of a low affinity IFN<ce><b1> but modified to exhibit higher receptor affinity than even for IFN<ce><b2>. Here, YNS<ce><b1>8 was fused with a 600-residue hydrophilic, unstructured N-terminal polypeptide chain comprising proline, alanine, and serine (PAS) to prolong its plasma half-life via ""PASylation."" PAS-YNS<ce><b1>8 exhibited a 10-fold increased half-life in both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic assays in a transgenic mouse model harboring the human receptors, notably without any detectable loss in biological potency or bioavailability. This long-lived superagonist conferred significantly improved protection from MOG35-55-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis compared with IFN<ce><b2>, despite being injected with a 4-fold less frequency and at an overall 16-fold lower dosage.

In this study, the effects of FTY720 and sodium valproate (VPA) as histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDAC) on the conductivity of visual signals, extent of demyelination area, glial activation, and expression levels of HDAC1and S1PR1 have been evaluated in the optic chiasm of lysolecithin (LPC)-induced demyelination model. In order to produce this demyelination model, LPC (1%, 2<e2><80><af><ce><bc>L) was injected into the rat optic chiasm. Latency of visual waves was measured by visual evoked potential (VEP) recording. The extent of demyelination area and level of glial activation were assessed using immunostaining. Gene expression analysis was performed to evaluate the expression levels of HDAC1, S1PR1, Olig2, and MBP in the optic chiasm. Analysis of electrophysiological data showed that LPC administration increased the latency of visual signals. FTY720 improved the functional recovery of the visual pathway and reduced the level of glial activation in the optic chiasm. FTY720 enhanced myelin repair and up-regulated the expression levels of Olig2 and MBP. Additionally, the expression levels of HDAC1 and S1PR1 were significantly reduced in animals treated with FTY720. In contrast to FTY720 treated animals, administration of VPA could not significantly improve the functional recovery of optic pathway following LPC injection. Cumulatively, the results of the present study demonstrate that FTY720 application improves the functional recovery of the optic pathway by reducing demyelination levels, amelioration of glial activation, and down-regulating of S1PR1 and HDAC1.",10.1016/j.brainresbull.2019.08.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2019.08.014,PH,1,NA,lysolecithin,rat,Wistar,male,NA,Fingolimod,control,1,72,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Hashemian_2019_BraResBul,JOUR,NA,"Animals and Demyelinating Diseases/chemically induced and Disease Models, Animal and Fingolimod Hydrochloride/metabolism/*pharmacology and Histone Deacetylase 1/metabolism and Lysophosphatidylcholines and Male and Multiple Sclerosis and Myelin Sheath/physiology and Oligodendroglia/drug effects and Optic Chiasm/*drug effects/metabolism and Rats and Rats, Wistar and Recovery of Function and Remyelination/*drug effects and Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors/metabolism and Valproic Acid/pharmacology and Demyelination and Fingolimod and Histone deacetylase and Lysolecithin and Visual evoked potential recording",eng,0361-9230,109-121,153,31442591,"Student Research Committee, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran; Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran.

Electrophysiological testing revealed a profound slowing of afferent conduction within the dorsal column of the spinal cord, and conduction abnormalities in the spinal roots. Injection with a lower cell dose of 1 x 10(6) T line cells caused only moderate clinical signs paralleled by milder conduction slowing and conduction failure. Light microscopy showed marked inflammation with infiltration of mononuclear cells and some demyelination throughout the spinal cord and roots. Inflammation and demyelination were dose dependent and the caudal parts of the spinal cord were more affected than the cranial parts. The peripheral nerves were free of electrophysiological and morphological alterations. Systemic treatment with 4-aminopyridine accelerated and partially restored conduction in the dorsal columns and roots, while increasing the body temperature had a detrimental effect, suggesting demyelination as a prominent pathophysiological mechanism.

However, studies of MS and the animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), indicate that neuronal pathology is the principle cause of clinical disability. Thus, there is need to develop new therapeutic strategies that not only address immunomodulation but also neuroprotection. Here we show that the combination therapy of Glatiramer acetate (GA), an immunomodulatory MS therapeutic, and the neuroprotectant epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the main phenol in green tea, have synergistic protective effects in vitro and in the EAE model. EGCG and GA together led to increased protection from glutamate- and TRAIL-induced neuronal cell death in vitro. EGCG combined with GA induced regeneration of hippocampal axons in an outgrowth assay. The combined application of EGCG and GA did not result in unexpected adverse events in vivo. Neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects could be translated in the in vivo model, where combination treatment with EGCG and GA significantly delayed disease onset, strongly reduced clinical severity, even after onset of symptoms and reduced inflammatory infiltrates.

DMF causes short-term oxidative stress and activates the antioxidant response via the transcription factor Nrf2 but its immunosuppressive effect is not well understood. Immune cell activation depends on calcium signaling which itself is influenced by the cellular redox state. We therefore measured calcium, reactive oxygen species levels and glutathione content in lymphocytes from immunized mice before onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from MS patients treated with DMF, and in mouse splenocytes treated ex vivo with DMF. This demonstrated altered redox states and increased lymphocytic calcium levels in all model systems. DMF caused an immediate influx of calcium from the extracellular space, long-term increased cytosolic calcium levels and reduced calcium stored in intracellular stores. The DMF-elicited current had the electrophysiological characteristics of a transient receptor potential channel and the intracellular calcium levels were normalized by antagonists of TRPA1. Interestingly, the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase SERCA2b was downregulated but more active due to glutathionylation of the redox-sensitive cysteine 674.

In animal models of various inflammatory and degenerative central nervous system disorders, GA-induced T cells cross the blood-brain barrier, secrete high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophins, and thus both reduce neuronal damage and promote neurogenesis. Recently, it has been suggested that GA itself may permeate the (impaired) blood-brain-barrier and directly protect neurons under conditions of inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration. To test this hypothesis, we examined the direct effects of GA on neuronal functionality and T cell-mediated neuronal apoptosis in culture, acute brain slices, and focal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. GA caused a depolarization of the resting membrane potential and led to an immediate impairment of action potential generation in neurons. Moreover, GA-incubated neurons underwent dose-dependent apoptosis. Apoptosis of ovalbumin peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex class I-expressing neurons induced by ovalbumin-specific effector T cells could be reduced by pre-incubation of T cells, but not neurons with GA. Similar results could be found using acute brain slices. In focal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, lesion size and neuronal apoptosis could be limited by pretreating rats with GA, whereas intracerebral GA application into the inflammatory lesion had no effect on neuronal survival. Our data suggest that GA attenuates adaptive pro-inflammatory T cell responses, but does not exert direct neuroprotective effects.",10.2353/ajpath.2010.100442,https://doi.org/10.2353/ajpath.2010.100442,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Dark Agouti,female,NA,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Herrmann_2010_AJP,JOUR,6,"Animals and Cell Death/drug effects/immunology and Cells, Cultured and Cytoprotection/drug effects/immunology and Down-Regulation/drug effects/immunology and Drug Evaluation, Preclinical and Embryo, Mammalian and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/immunology/metabolism/pathology and Glatiramer Acetate and Inflammation/immunology/metabolism/*pathology and Inflammation Mediators/metabolism and Membrane Potentials/drug effects and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Transgenic and Neurons/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology and Peptides/*pharmacology and Rats and Rats, Transgenic and T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism",eng,0002-9440 (Print) 0002-9440,3051-60,177,21037084,"Department of Neurology-Inflammatory Disorders of the Nervous System and Neurooncology, University of MÃ¼nster, Domagkstr. 13, 48149 MÃ¼nster, Germany.",NA,NA,NA,PMC2993293,Dec,NLM,1106,"ASReview_relevant and 1525-2191 and Herrmann, Alexander M and G<c3><b6>bel, Kerstin and Simon, Ole J and Melzer, Nico and Schuhmann, Michael K and Stenner, Max-Philipp and Weishaupt, Andreas and Kleinschnitz, Christoph and Bittner, Stefan and Meuth, Patrick and Stuve, Olaf and Budde, Thomas and Kieseier, Bernd C and Wiendl, Heinz and Meuth, Sven G and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2010/11/03 and Am J Pathol. 2010 Dec;177(6):3051-60. doi: 10.2353/ajpath.2010.100442.

Moreover, it has been shown that vitamin D downregulates major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. We here report about the impact of a dietary vitamin D supplementation on EAE in the rat strains having functionally relevant allelic variations in the CIITA (Mhc2ta) gene, a master regulator of MHC class II expression. Full length myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-EAE was induced in DA.PVG(av1)-Vra4 congenic rats harboring the Vra4 locus from PVG strain in the EAE- susceptible DA background, and compared to the parental strains. The congenic rats fed with either vitamin D supplemented, deprived or regular diet developed an intermediate clinical EAE phenotype, in contrast to DA and PVG strains. Immunopathological studies revealed vitamin D dose-dependent effect on demyelination and inflammatory infiltration of the central nervous system (CNS), expression of MHC class II and CIITA, as well as downregulation of a range of pro-inflammatory genes. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an impact of vitamin D on the target tissue pathology and peripheral immune response during EAE in DA.PVG(av1)-Vra4 congenic strain.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the glial response in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-induced mice treated with a combination of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and pregabalin (PGB). For that, 28 C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to the five experimental groups: na<c3><af>ve, EAE, EAE-DMF, EAE-PGB, and EAE-DMF + PGB. Pharmacological treatments were initiated with the beginning of clinical signs, and all animals were euthanized at 28 dpi for the lumbar spinal cord evaluation. The results demonstrated a stronger attenuation of the clinical presentation by the combined approach. DMF alone promoted the downregulation of Iba-1 (microglia/macrophages marker) in the ventral horn compared with the non-treated EAE animals (P < 0.05). PGB treatment was associated with reduced Iba-1 immunofluorescence in both the dorsal (P < 0.05) and ventral horn (P < 0.05) compared to EAE vehicle-treated counterparts. However, the combined approach reduced the Iba-1 marker in the dorsal (P < 0.05) and ventral (P < 0.01) horns compared to non-treated EAE animals and further reduced Iba-1 in the ventral horn compared to each drug-alone approach (P < 0.05). In addition, the combination of DMF and PGB reduced activated astrocytes (GFAP) in both the dorsal and ventral horns of the spinal cord to a na<c3><af>ve-like level and upregulated Nrf-2 expression.

We investigated the potential of vitamin D (VD) to enhance GC efficacy and the mechanisms underlying this VD/GC interaction. In vitro, GC receptor (GR) expression levels were quantified by ELISA and induction of T cell apoptosis served as a functional readout to assess synergistic 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (1,25D)/GC effects. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (MOG(35-55) EAE) was induced in mice with T cell-specific GR or mTORc1 deficiency. 25(OH)D (25D) levels were determined in two independent cohorts of MS patients with stable disease or relapses either responsive or resistant to GC treatment (initial cohort: n<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>110; validation cohort: n<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>85). Gene expression of human CD8(+) T cells was analyzed by microarray (n<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>112) and correlated with 25D serum levels. In vitro, 1,25D upregulated GR protein levels, leading to increased GC-induced T cell apoptosis. 1,25D/GC combination therapy ameliorated clinical EAE course more efficiently than respective monotherapies, which was dependent on GR expression in T cells. In MS patients from two independent cohorts, 25D deficiency was associated with GC-resistant relapses. Mechanistic studies revealed that synergistic 1,25D/GC effects on apoptosis induction were mediated by the mTOR but not JNK pathway. In line, 1,25D inhibited mTORc1 activity in murine T cells, and low 25D levels in humans were associated with a reduced expression of mTORc1 inhibiting tuberous sclerosis complex 1 in CD8(+) T cells. GR upregulation by 1,25D and 1,25D/GC synergism in vitro and therapeutic efficacy in vivo were abolished in animals with a T cell-specific mTORc1 deficiency. Specific inhibition of mTORc1 by everolimus increased the efficacy of GC in EAE. 1,25D augments GC-mediated effects in vitro and in vivo in a T cell-specific, GR-dependent manner via mTORc1 inhibition.

We investigated the mechanism of fingolimod action in the classical animal model of MS: experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Fingolimod treatment significantly reduced clinical scores and histopathology in this model, even when treatment was begun after the onset of pathology. The Akt-mTOR signaling pathway was shown to be activated in the EAE model, by measuring the abundance of downstream activation markers, pAkt and ps6k. And this pathway was inhibited when EAE mice were treated with fingolimod. Mice with EAE exhibited an increased frequency of Th1 cells in the spleen, with concomitant increases in the mRNA levels of Tbet and Ifng and increased IFN-<ce><b3> production by activated splenocytes; the frequency of Treg cells, as well as mRNA levels of Foxp3 and Tgfb, was reduced, as was TGF-<ce><b2> production by activated splenocytes. After treatment with fingolimod, these parameters were reversed, suggesting that fingolimod treatment inhibits the Akt-mTOR axis in EAE, which affects the differentiation and function of Th1 and Treg cells.

S.",2013,Stem Cell Res Ther,Effective combination of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and minocycline in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice,"INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). Minocycline ameliorates the clinical severity of MS and exhibits antiinflammatory, neuroprotective activities, and good tolerance for long-term use, whereas it is toxic to the CNS. Recently, the immunomodulation and neuroprotection capabilities of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) were shown in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this study, we evaluated whether the combination of hBM-MSCs and a low-dose minocycline could produce beneficial effects in EAE mice. METHODS: The sensitivity of hBM-MSCs to minocycline was determined by an established cell-viability assay. Minocycline-treated hBM-MSCs were also characterized with flow cytometry by using MSC surface markers and analyzed for their multiple differentiation capacities. EAE was induced in C57BL/6 mice by using immunization with MOG35-55. Immunopathology assays were used to detect the inflammatory cells, demyelination, and neuroprotection. Interferon gamma (IFN-<ce><b3>)/tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-<ce><b1>) and interleukin-4 (IL-4)/interleukin-10 (IL-10), the hallmark cytokines that direct Th1 and Th2 development, were detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed to elucidate the cell apoptosis in the spinal cords of EAE mice. RESULTS: Minocycline did not affect the viability, surface phenotypes, or differentiation capacity of hBM-MSCs, while minocycline affected the viability of astrocytes at a high dose. In vivo efficacy experiments showed that combined treatment, compared to the use of minocycline or hBM-MSCs alone, resulted in a significant reduction in clinical scores, along with attenuation of inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. Moreover, the combined treatment with hBM-MSCs and minocycline enhanced the immunomodulatory effects, which suppressed proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-<ce><b3>, TNF-<ce><b1>) and conversely increased anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10). In addition, TUNEL staining also demonstrated a significant decrease of the number of apoptotic cells in the combined treatment compared with either treatment alone. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of hBM-MSCs and minocycline provides a novel experimental protocol to enhance the therapeutic effects in MS.",10.1186/scrt228,https://doi.org/10.1186/scrt228,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,11,Minocycline,control,1,40,1,1.3,10,0.6,4,10,0.5,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Hou_2013_SteCelResThe,JOUR,4,"Animals and Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use and Apoptosis and Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism and Cell Differentiation and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/genetics/*metabolism and Humans and Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods and Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Minocycline/*therapeutic use",eng,1757-6512,77,4,23826999,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMC3854709,45112,NLM,896,"ASReview_relevant and 1757-6512 and Hou, Yun and Ryu, Chung Heon and Park, Kwang Ywel and Kim, Seong Muk and Jeong, Chang Hyun and Jeun, Sin-Soo and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and England and 2013/07/06 and Stem Cell Res Ther. 2013 Jul 5;4(4):77. doi: 10.1186/scrt228.",Effective combination of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and minocycline in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice,NA,NA,20130705,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,186

C. and St<c3><bc>ve, O.",2009,PLoS One,PEG minocycline-liposomes ameliorate CNS autoimmune disease,"BACKGROUND: Minocycline is an oral tetracycline derivative with good bioavailability in the central nervous system (CNS). Minocycline, a potent inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, attenuates disease activity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Potential adverse effects associated with long-term daily minocycline therapy in human patients are concerning. Here, we investigated whether less frequent treatment with long-circulating polyethylene glycol (PEG) minocycline liposomes are effective in treating EAE. FINDINGS: Performing in vitro time kinetic studies of PEG minocycline-liposomes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we determined that PEG minocycline-liposome preparations stabilized with CaCl(2) are effective in diminishing MMP-9 activity. Intravenous injections of PEG minocycline-liposomes every five days were as effective in ameliorating clinical EAE as daily intraperitoneal injections of minocycline. Treatment of animals with PEG minocycline-liposomes significantly reduced the number of CNS-infiltrating leukocytes, and the overall expression of MMP-9 in the CNS. There was also a significant suppression of MMP-9 expression and proteolytic activity in splenocytes of treated animals, but not in CNS-infiltrating leukocytes. Thus, leukocytes gaining access to the brain and spinal cord require the same absolute amount of MMP-9 in all treatment groups, but minocycline decreases the absolute cell number. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that less frequent injections of PEG minocycline-liposomes are an effective alternative pharmacotherapy to daily minocycline injections for the treatment of CNS autoimmune diseases. Also, inhibition of MMP-9 remains a promising treatment target in EAE and patients with MS.",10.1371/journal.pone.0004151,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0004151,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,8,Minocycline,control,1,NA,2,0.8,5,0.4,3.2,5,0.6,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Hu_2009_PLoOne,JOUR,1,"Animals and Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology and Female and Humans and Liposomes and Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism and Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors and Matrix Metalloproteinases/metabolism and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Minocycline/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use and Nervous System Autoimmune Disease, Experimental/drug therapy/immunology and Polyethylene Glycols/*metabolism/pharmacology",eng,1932-6203,e4151,4,19127301,"Department of Neurology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas, United States of America.",NA,NA,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,PMC2613526,NA,NLM,1238,"ASReview_relevant and 1932-6203 and Hu, Wei and Metselaar, Josbert and Ben, Li-Hong and Cravens, Petra D and Singh, Mahendra P and Frohman, Elliot M and Eagar, Todd N and Racke, Michael K and Kieseier, Bernd C and St<c3><bc>ve, Olaf and RG2969B7/T/RG/CSR NIH HHS/United States and RG3427A8/T/RG/CSR NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. and United States and 2009/01/08 and PLoS One. 2009;4(1):e4151. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0004151.

While the immunological effects of FTY720 are well established, there is controversy in the literature regarding the contribution of FTY720 on myelin repair. Here, we directly assessed the impact of FTY720 on myelin repair in cuprizone and lysolecithin (LPC) demyelination models that have a minimal immunological component. FTY720 failed to promote remyelination in either animal model.

B cell depleting capacity was explored in healthy female C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice; following immune activation in two different mouse models: trinitrophenylated lipopolysaccharide model (thymus-independent response) and dinitrophenyl-keyhole limpet hemocyanin model (thymus-dependent response); and in a chronic neuroinflammation experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model. CD20 protein expression on B cell subpopulations was also studied. The subcutaneous anti-CD20 regimen resulted in rapid depletion of B cells in blood, lymph nodes and spleen. Low-dose subcutaneous treatment did not reduce antigen-specific immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G titers in all subgroups, and relatively spared splenic marginal zone (MZ) B cells in both T cell dependent and T cell independent B cell immunization models. Analysis of immune compartments during anti-CD20-modulated autoimmune neuroinflammation showed that the maximal B cell depletion was achieved within 2<c2><a0>days of treatment and was highest in the lymph node. Regardless of the tissues analyzed, low-dose subcutaneous treatment was characterized by rapid B cell repletion following treatment cessation. CD20 protein expression was consistent on all B cell subsets in blood, and was more pronounced in germinal center B cells of lymph nodes and MZ B-cells of the spleen. Low-dose subcutaneous anti-CD20 therapy effectively depleted B cells within lymphatic tissues and reduced the severity of neuroinflammation. These data suggest that subcutaneous anti-CD20 therapies can effectively target disease-relevant B cell populations, have shorter repletion kinetics and maintain vaccination responses, thereby achieving autoimmune amelioration without severely impacting immune surveillance functions.

While inflammation is present at all stages of MS, it is more pronounced in the relapsing forms of the disease, whereas progressive MS (PMS) shows significant neuroaxonal damage and grey and white matter atrophy. Hence, disease-modifying treatments beneficial in patients with relapsing MS have limited success in PMS. BAF312 (siponimod) is a novel sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator shown to delay progression in PMS. Besides reducing inflammation by sequestering lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues, BAF312 crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds its receptors on neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. To evaluate potential direct neuroprotective effects, BAF312 was systemically or locally administered in the CNS of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice with distinct grey- and white-matter lesions (focal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis using an osmotic mini-pump). Ex-vivo flow cytometry revealed that systemic but not local BAF312 administration lowered immune cell infiltration in animals with both grey and white matter lesions. Ex-vivo voltage-sensitive dye imaging of acute brain slices revealed an altered spatio-temporal pattern of activation in the lesioned cortex compared to controls in response to electrical stimulation of incoming white-matter fiber tracts. Here, BAF312 administration showed partial restore of cortical neuronal circuit function. The data suggest that BAF312 exerts a neuroprotective effect after crossing the blood-brain barrier independently of peripheral effects on immune cells.

This study investigated neurophysiological deficits in descending spinal cord motor tracts during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a model of multiple sclerosis) and the functional effectiveness of prophylactic or therapeutic teriflunomide treatment in preventing the debilitating paralysis observed in this model. Relapsing-remitting EAE was induced in Dark Agouti rats using rat spinal cord homogenate. Animals were treated with oral teriflunomide (10 mg/kg daily) prophylactically, therapeutically, or with vehicle (control). Transcranial magnetic motor-evoked potentials were measured throughout the disease to provide quantitative assessment of the neurophysiological status of descending motor tracts. Axonal damage was quantified histologically by silver staining. Both prophylactic and therapeutic teriflunomide treatment significantly reduced maximum EAE disease scores (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0001, respectively) compared with vehicle-treated rats. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that both teriflunomide treatment regimens prevented a delay in wave-form latency and a decrease in wave-form amplitude compared with that observed in vehicle-treated animals. A significant reduction in axonal loss was observed with both teriflunomide treatment regimens compared with vehicle (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0014, respectively). The results of this study suggest that therapeutic teriflunomide can prevent the deficits observed in this animal model in descending spinal cord motor tracts. The mechanism behind reduced axonal loss and improved motor function may be primarily the reduced inflammation and consequent demyelination observed in these animals through the known effects of teriflunomide on impairing proliferation of stimulated T cells. These findings may have significant implications for patients with RMS.",10.1124/jpet.113.205146,https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.113.205146,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Dark Agouti,male,8,Teriflunomide,control,1,72,"1,2",0.4,13,0.1,3.5,11,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Iglesias.Bregna_2013_JPET,JOUR,1,"Animals and Crotonates/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and *Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/physiopathology/*therapy and Evoked Potentials, Motor/drug effects/*physiology and Hydroxybutyrates and Male and Nitriles and Rats and Toluidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and *Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation/methods and Treatment Outcome",eng,0022-3565,203-11,347,23892570,"Sanofi, Bridgewater, New Jersey.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Oct,NLM,888,"ASReview_relevant and 1521-0103 and Iglesias-Bregna, Deborah and Hanak, Susan and Ji, Zhongqi and Petty, Margaret and Liu, Li and Zhang, Donghui and McMonagle-Strucko, Kathleen and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2013/07/31 and J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2013 Oct;347(1):203-11. doi: 10.1124/jpet.113.205146.

It is a prodrug that requires activation by sphingosine kinase 2 (SK-2) to induce T cell homing to secondary lymphoid tissue. In this study, we have investigated the role of SK-2 in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6 mice. We show that SK-2 deficiency reduced clinical symptoms of EAE. Furthermore, in SK-2-deficient mice, the protective effect of FTY720 on EAE was abolished, while the non-prodrug FTY720-derivative ST-968 was still fully active. Protection was paralleled by reduced numbers of T-lymphocytes in blood and a reduced blood-brain-barrier leakage. This correlated with reduced mRNA expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, but enhanced expression of PECAM-1. A similar regulation of permeability and of PECAM-1 was seen in primary cultures of isolated mouse brain vascular endothelial cells and in a human immortalized cell line upon SK-2 knockdown. In summary, these data demonstrated that deletion of SK-2 exerts a protective effect on the pathogenesis of EAE in C57BL/6 mice and that SK-2 is essential for the protective effect of FTY720 but not of ST-968.

Fingolimod (FTY720) is the first functional antagonist of S1P(1) that has been approved for oral treatment of MS. Previously, we have developed novel butterfly derivatives of FTY720 that acted similar to FTY720 in reducing disease symptoms in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this study, we have synthesized a piperidine derivative of the oxazolo-oxazole compounds, denoted ST-1505, and its ring-opened analogue ST-1478, and characterised their in-vitro and in-vivo functions. Notably, the 3-piperidinopropyloxy moiety resembles a structural motif of pitolisant, a drug with histamine H(3)R antagonistic/inverse agonist activity approved for the treatment of narcolepsy. Both novel compounds exerted H(3)R affinities, and in addition, ST-1505 was characterised as a dual S1P(1+3) agonist, whereas ST-1478 was a dual S1P(1+5) agonist. Both multitargeting compounds were also active in mice and reduced the lymphocyte numbers as well as diminished disease symptoms in the mouse model of MS. The effect of ST-1478 was dependent on SK-2 activity suggesting that it is a prodrug like FTY720, but with a more selective S1P receptor activation profile, whereas ST-1505 is a fully active drug even in the absence of SK-2.

The inhibition of Rac1 activation and ROS generation suppressed the activity of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which resulted in attenuated EAE pathogenicity. We further found that two subsets of EAE could be defined on the basis of their dependency on the NLRP3 inflammasome and that IFN-<ce><b2> was not an effective therapy when EAE was induced in an NLRP3 inflammasome-independent fashion. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously uncharacterized signaling pathway that is involved in the suppression of EAE by IFN-<ce><b2> and characterizes NLRP3-independent EAE, which cannot be treated with IFN-<ce><b2>.",10.1126/scisignal.2002767,https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.2002767,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,male,NA,Interferon Beta 1,control,1,NA,1,0,NA,0,3,NA,0,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Inoue_2012_SciSig,JOUR,225,"Animals and Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins and CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins and CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/transplantation and Carrier Proteins/genetics/*physiology and Caspase 1/physiology and Cytoskeletal Proteins/deficiency and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug and therapy/immunology/physiopathology and Enzyme Activation and Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects and Inflammasomes/*physiology and Interferon beta-1b and Interferon-beta/*therapeutic use and Interleukin-1beta/biosynthesis/genetics and Macrophages/physiology and Male and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Knockout and Mice, Transgenic and NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein and Neuropeptides/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology and Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology and Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism and Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta/deficiency/*physiology and Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use and Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein and Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology and rac GTP-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology and rac1 GTP-Binding Protein",eng,1945-0877,ra38,5,22623753,"Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.",NA,NA,NA,PMC3509177,45068,NLM,978,"ASReview_relevant and 1937-9145 and Inoue, Makoto and Williams, Kristi L and Oliver, Timothy and Vandenabeele, Peter and Rajan, Jayant V and Miao, Edward A and Shinohara, Mari L and R01 AI088100/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and R01 AI097518/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and R56 AI089756/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and AI089756/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2012/05/25 and Sci Signal. 2012 May 22;5(225):ra38. doi: 10.1126/scisignal.2002767.",Interferon-Î² therapy against EAE is effective only when development of the disease depends on the NLRP3 inflammasome,NA,NA,20120522,NA,NA,NA,NIHMS421371,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Marketed,NA,196

Here, the VD effects on expression of some Th17 cell- related cytokines, chemokines and chemokine receptors were investigated in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Methods: One group of C57BL/6 mice, considered as healthy group, was treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). EAE was induced in other three groups and treated from day +3 to +30 with PBS, olive oil (VD vehicle) or 200 ng of VD. At day 31, the expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-23, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20), CCL22, CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) and CCR6 in spinal cord and serum IL-17 and IL-23 levels were measured by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Results: The expression of IL-17, IL-23 P19, IL-23 P40, CCL20, CCL22 and CCR4 in spinal cord and serum IL-17 and IL-23 levels in PBS-administrated EAE mice were significantly increased compared with healthy group. In EAE mice treated with VD, the expression of aforementioned parameters was significantly reduced in comparison with PBS-administrated EAE mice.

Thus, we hypothesized that mice with chronic EAE may also benefit from this combination therapy. We first assessed how a treatment with a single dose of GA together with daily application of EGCG may modulate EAE. Although single therapies with a suboptimal dose of GA or EGCG led to disease amelioration and reduced CNS inflammation, the combination therapy had no effects. While EGCG appeared to preserve axons and myelin, the single GA dose did not improve axonal damage or demyelination. Interestingly, the neuroprotective effect of EGCG was abolished when GA was applied in combination. To elucidate how a single dose of GA may interfere with EGCG, we focused on the anti-inflammatory, iron chelating and anti-oxidant properties of EGCG. Surprisingly, we observed that while EGCG induced a downregulation of the gene expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in affected CNS areas, the combined therapy of GA+EGCG seems to promote an increased HO-1 expression. These data suggest that upregulation of HO-1 may contribute to diminish the neuroprotective benefits of EGCG alone in this EAE model. Altogether, our data indicate that neuroprotection by EGCG in chronic EAE may involve regulation of oxidative processes, including downmodulation of HO-1. Further investigation of the re-dox balance in chronic neuroinflammation and in particular functional studies on HO-1 are warranted to understand its role in disease progression.",10.1371/journal.pone.0130251,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0130251,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,9,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,69,2,0.8,17,0.3,2.8,17,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Janssen_2015_PLoOne,JOUR,6,"Animals and Axons/enzymology/pathology and Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology and Chronic Disease and Down-Regulation/*drug effects and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology and Female and Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects and Glatiramer Acetate/*pharmacology and Heme Oxygenase-1/*biosynthesis and Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis and Mice and Myelin Sheath/enzymology/pathology and Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects",eng,1932-6203,e0130251,10,26114502,"Institute for Medical Immunology, CharitÃ©-UniversitÃ¤tmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Experimental and Clinical Research Center, joint cooperation between the CharitÃ© Medical Faculty and the Max-DelbrÃ¼ck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.

We now show that estrogens ameliorate chronic EAE. Castration of female mice led to an earlier disease onset (day 9 +/- 2 postimmunization (p.i.) in castrated mice vs. day 16 +/- 4 p.i. in normal mice). Long-term treatment with high levels of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) given as Silastic implants led to a dramatically delayed onset of disease in both castrated and normal female mice (mean onset day was day 39 +/- 14 and day 50 +/- 3, respectively). Treatment of castrated females by injections of E2, at a concentration which induces the serum levels seen at late stage pregnancy, delayed the onset approximately 1 week (mean onset 21 +/- 8). In contrast, treatment with estriol (E3), which was also given at doses corresponding to those levels seen during pregnancy, delayed the disease onset for a longer time (mean onset day 31 +/- 5). Five times higher doses of E2, compared with those seen during pregnancy, were required to obtain similar effects as the low E3 dose. The same mouse strain (B10.RIII) is also susceptible to induction of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). We show here that also CIA is suppressed by the same treatments with E2 and E3, suggesting that similar estrogen-mediated mechanisms may operate to suppress these T-cell-dependent autoimmune disease models.",10.1016/0165-5728(94)90030-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-5728(94)90030-2,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,B10.RIII,female,10,Estriol,control,1,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Jansson_1994_JN,JOUR,2,"Animals and Arthritis/chemically induced/*drug therapy and Collagen and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy and Estrogens/*therapeutic use and Female and Mice",eng,0165-5728 (Print) 0165-5728,203-7,53,8071434,"Department of Medical and Physiological Chemistry, Uppsala University, Sweden.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Sep,NLM,1809,"ASReview_relevant and Jansson, L and Olsson, T and Holmdahl, R and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Netherlands and 1994/09/01 and J Neuroimmunol. 1994 Sep;53(2):203-7. doi: 10.1016/0165-5728(94)90030-2.",Estrogen induces a potent suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and collagen-induced arthritis in mice,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,201

L.",2006,Int Immunol,Do Th2 cells mediate the effects of glatiramer acetate in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis?,"Mechanisms underlying the clinical benefits of glatiramer acetate (GA) for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) remain elusive. A prevailing hypothesis is that GA can induce Th2-polarized T cells, which cross-recognize myelin-specific epitopes and can inhibit myelin-reactive autoaggression in Th1 T cells, a process referred to as 'bystander suppression.' To test whether the efficacy of GA is indeed mediated by Th2 T cells, we have utilized an animal model for MS: experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6 mice. GA therapy conferred moderate protection from EAE. GA-reactive T cells from these mice were not Th2 polarized, and the Th1 cytokine reduction of myelin-reactive T cells in GA-treated mice was comparable to that in untreated control mice. Significantly, the protective effects of GA against EAE were also observed in IL-4-, IL-10-deficient and IL-4/IL-10 double-deficient mice. Similar to wild-type mice, GA therapy in IL-4- and IL-10-deficient mice was associated with diminished myelin-reactive T cell expansion and reduced production of myelin antigen-induced IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Thus, despite the absence of two prominent Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-10, either alone or combined, GA was still beneficial in suppressing EAE.

The involvement of Tregs in therapies for immune-mediated diseases has been proposed, but direct supporting evidence is still lacking. While investigating mechanisms underlying the clinical benefits of glatiramer acetate (GA) in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), i.e., experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we recently demonstrated that GA can protect mice deficient in the Th(2) cytokines IL-4, IL-10 and IL-4/IL-10 from acquiring EAE, suggesting that mechanisms other than Th(2) cells may be responsible for the therapeutic effects of GA. Here we demonstrate that GA treatment boosts the expression of Foxp3 on Tregs during EAE. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of purified Tregs from GA-treated EAE mice is more effective in preventing EAE development than Tregs from untreated EAE controls. Thus, our current data provide evidence that Tregs may be the major contributor to GA's therapeutic action in EAE and, possibly, MS.

It acts as a functional antagonist for sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR). After phosphorylateion by sphingosine kinase in vivo, FTY binds to S1PR on lymphocytes to downregulate S1PR, thereby preventing lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissues to reduce infiltration of autoreactive lymphocytes into the central nervous system. FTY easily passes through the blood-brain barrier and directly affects cells in the central nervous system. Recently, we have shown that FTY exerts neuroprotective effects by suppressing pro-inflammatory functions of glial cells and by upregulating neuroprotective functions of neuronal and glial cells in vitro. In the present study, we examined whether FTY exerts neuroprotective effects in vivo in the chronic phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Methods Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced EAE mice were orally treated with FTY (1 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (water) once a day starting at the disease peak (15 days after immunization). To evaluate gliosis and axonal damage, the lumbar spinal cords were examined immunohistochemically at 28 days after immunization. Results FTY treatment starting at disease peak improved the severity of symptoms, and reduced gliosis and axonal damage in the spinal cord, as assessed by glial staining and formation of neuritic bead/spheroid. Conclusions FTY exerts protective effects on axonal impairments during the chronic phase of EAE.

The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], has a direct repressive effect on the expression of IL-17A in both human and mouse T cells. In vivo treatment of mice with ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a mouse model of multiple sclerosis) diminishes paralysis and progression of the disease and reduces IL-17A-secreting CD4(+) T cells in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS). The mechanism of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) repression of IL-17A expression was found to be transcriptional repression, mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Transcription assays, gel shifting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicate that the negative effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on IL-17A involves blocking of nuclear factor for activated T cells (NFAT), recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC), sequestration of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)/VDR, and a direct effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on induction of Foxp3.

Currently available therapies have partially effective actions and numerous side reactions. Inosine, an endogenous purine nucleoside, has immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and analgesic properties. Herein, we evaluated the effect of inosine on the development and progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an experimental model of MS. Inosine (1 or 10<c2><a0>mg/kg, i.p.) was administrated twice a day for 40<c2><a0>days. Immunological and inflammatory responses were evaluated by behavioral, histological, immunohistochemical, ELISA, RT-PCR, and Western blotting analysis. The administration of inosine exerted neuroprotective effects against EAE by diminishing clinical signs, including thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia, as well as weight loss typical of the disease. These beneficial effects of inosine seem to be associated with the blockade of inflammatory cell entry into the CNS, especially lymphocytes, thus delaying the demyelinating process and astrocytes activation. In particular, up-regulation of IL-17 levels in the secondary lymphoid tissues, a result of EAE, was prevented by inosine treatment in EAE mice. Additionally, inosine consistently prevented A2AR up-regulation in the spinal cord, likely, through an ERK1-independent pathway. Altogether, these results allow us to propose that this endogenous purine might be a putative novel and helpful tool for the prevention of autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, such as MS. Thus, inosine could have considerable implications for future therapies of MS, and this study may represent the starting point for further investigation into the role of inosine and adenosinergic receptors in neuroinflammation processes. Graphical Abstract Preventive treatment with inosine inhibits the development and progression of EAE in C57Bl/6 mice. Furthermore, neuroinflammation and demyelinating processes were blocked by inosine treatment. Additionally, inosine consistently inhibited IL-17 levels in peripheral lymphoid tissue, as well as IL-4 levels and A2AR up-regulation in the spinal cord, likely, through an ERK1-independent pathway.

Glatiramer acetate (GA), a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for the treatment of MS, has a good safety profile. But GA's mechanism of action in MS is still elusive. In this study, we showed that B cells from GA-treated mice increased production of IL-10 and reduced expression of co-stimulatory molecules viz.: CD80 and CD86. B cells from GA-treated mice also diminished proliferation of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG(35-55)) specific T cells. Purified B cells transferred from GA-treated mice suppressed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in recipient mice compared with B cells transferred from mice treated with PBS or ovalbumin. The treatment effect of GA in EAE was abrogated in B cell-deficient mice. Transfer of B cells from GA-treated mice inhibited the proliferation of autoreactive T cells as well as the development of Th1 and Th17 cells but promoted IL-10 production in recipient mice. The number of peripheral CD11b(+) macrophages in recipient mice also decreased after transfer of B cells from GA-treated mice; however, the number of dendritic cells and regulatory T cells remained unaltered.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was induced in 14 marmosets by immunization with recombinant human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein in complete Freund adjuvant. At 21 days after immunization, B-cell depletion was achieved by weekly intravenous injections of HuMab 7D8, a human-anti-human CD20 antibody that cross-reacts with marmoset CD20. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging showed widespread brain white matter demyelination in control marmosets that was absent in CD20 antibody-treated marmosets. High-contrast postmortem magnetic resonance imaging showed white matter lesions in 4of the 7 antibody-treated marmosets, but these were significantly smaller than those in controls. The same technique revealed gray matter lesions in 5 control marmosets, but none in antibody-treated marmosets. Histologic analysis confirmed that inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage were substantially reduced in brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves of CD20 antibody-treated marmosets. In conclusion, CD20-postive B-cell depletion by HuMab 7D8 profoundly reduced the development of both white and gray matter lesions in the marmoset CNS. These data underline the central role of B cells in CNS inflammatory-demyelinating disease. <c2><a9> 2011 by the American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.",10.1097/NEN.0b013e318234d421,https://doi.org/10.1097/NEN.0b013e318234d421,WZ,1,NA,EAE,marmoset,C57BL/6,male,128,Rituximab,control,1,14,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,97.2,7,1.4,96.1,7,3.3,"mean, SEM",brain volume,NA,Kap_2011_JoofNeanExNe,JOUR,11,CD20 antibody and human monoclonal antibody and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and autoimmune encephalomyelitis and animal experiment and animal model and article and B lymphocyte and brain and Callitrichinae and cell function and central nervous system and controlled study and demyelination and gray matter and immunization and in vivo study and inflammation and lymphocyte depletion and male and multiple sclerosis and nonhuman and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and optic nerve and priority journal and spinal cord and white matter,English,0022-3069 1554-6578,992-1005,70,NA,"Y.S.

The etiology of the disease remains unknown, which strongly impedes the development of effective therapy. Most MS treatments focus on modulating the activity of the immune system. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) exerts a broad spectrum of action, such as modulating immune cell differentiation towards anti-inflammatory subtypes, influencing cytokine production, regulating immune cell migration into the central nervous system, and activating intracellular antioxidant mechanisms. It is well established that activation of the nuclear factor E2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway, leading to expression of the second-phase antioxidant enzymes, is influenced by DMF. In our experiments we used female Lewis rats in an animal model of MS - experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). The rats were fed with dimethyl fumarate to test the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), one of the second-phase antioxidant enzymes, at specific time points of the symptomatic phases of the disease: on the first day of the occurrence of clinical symptoms (10th day post immunization, DPI); at the peak of clinical symptoms (14th DPI); and at the end of the relapse (21st DPI). The results showed that HO-1 expression, at both the mRNA and protein level, is influenced by DMF administration only at the very beginning of the symptomatic phase of EAE, and not at the peak of clinical symptoms, nor at the end of the relapse. This indicates that the regulation of the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway by DMF occurs at a certain time interval (early EAE/MS) and strongly underlines the importance of the earliest introduction of the therapy to the patient. .",10.5114/fn.2017.72394,https://doi.org/10.5114/fn.2017.72394,WZ,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,female,NA,Dimethyl fumarate,control,NA,48,1,0.9,8,0.5,0.8,8,0.6,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Beginning on the 3rd DPI, the animals received dimethyl fumarate (Sigma-Aldrich), twice a day at adose of 15 mg/kg, intragastrically using agauge-point-ed needle, up to the day of animal euthanasia.

Its main mechanism of action is through peripheral immunomodulation but neuroprotective effects may also be involved. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were shown to exert immunomodulatory and neurotrophic effects in the model of multiple sclerosis (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis-EAE). The use of combination treatments in chronic diseases such as MS, has long been advocated and may result in improvement of the beneficial effects of each one of them. We tested the in vitro effects of Fingolimod (FTY720) on MSC and the in vivo effect of such combination treatment in the model of EAE. Fingolimod did not affect in any detrimental way the basic features of MSCs and it promoted their migration and proliferation ability .Moreover, Fingolimod induced neurotrophic factors secretion and suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from astrocytes and microglia, in vitro. In vivo, the combined treatment of FTY720 and MSC (either by the intravenous or the intra-cerebroventricular route of administration) resulted in synergistic clinical beneficial effects compared to FTY720 or MSC alone, paralleled by a significant reduction of inflammatory CNS infiltrations and of axonal loss.

Prophylactic administration of FTY720 at 0.1 to 1 mg/kg almost completely prevented the development of EAE, and therapeutic treatment with FTY720 significantly inhibited the progression of EAE and EAE-associated histological change in the spinal cords of LEW rats induced by immunization with myelin basic protein. Consistent with rat EAE, the development of proteolipid protein-induced EAE in SJL/J mice was almost completely prevented and infiltration of CD4(+) T cells into spinal cord was decreased by prophylactic treatment with FTY720 and (S)-FTY720-P. When FTY720 or (S)-FTY720-P was given after establishment of EAE in SJL/J mice, the relapse of EAE was markedly inhibited as compared with interferon-beta, and the area of demyelination and the infiltration of CD4(+) T cells were decreased in spinal cords of EAE mice.

AN100226m, a monoclonal antibody to alpha 4 integrin has been previously shown to reverse the clinical and histologic signs of EAE by blocking this interaction. In the present study, AN100226m treatment in acute EAE significantly decreased contrast enhancement of the CNS parenchyma indicating closure of the blood-brain barrier.

However, the mechanisms by which ER<ce><b1> signaling contributes to changes in disease pathogenesis have not been completely elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that ER<ce><b1> deletion in dendritic cells (DCs) of mice induces severe neurodegeneration in the central nervous system in a mouse EAE model and resistance to interferon beta (IFN<ce><b2>), a first-line MS treatment. Estrogen synthesized by extragonadal sources is crucial for controlling disease phenotypes. Mechanistically, activated ER<ce><b1> directly interacts with TRAF3, a TLR4 downstream signaling molecule, to degrade TRAF3 via ubiquitination, resulting in reduced IRF3 nuclear translocation and transcription of membrane lymphotoxin (mLT) and IFN<ce><b2> components. Diminished ER<ce><b1> signaling in DCs generates neurotoxic effector CD4(+) T cells via mLT-lymphotoxin beta receptor (LT<ce><b2>R) signaling. Lymphotoxin beta receptor antagonist abolished EAE disease symptoms in the DC-specific ER<ce><b1>-deficient mice. These findings indicate that estrogen derived from extragonadal sources, such as lymph nodes, controls TRAF3-mediated cytokine production in DCs to modulate the EAE disease phenotype.",10.15252/embr.202154228,https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202154228,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,both,7,Interferon Beta 1,control,NA,NA,1,0.6,8,0.2,2.7,8,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Khaw_2023_EMBRep,JOUR,3,"Mice and Animals and *Estrogen Receptor alpha/genetics/metabolism and Lymphotoxin beta Receptor/genetics/metabolism and TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 3/genetics/metabolism and *Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental and Estrogens/pharmacology and Phenotype and Dendritic Cells/metabolism and Mice, Inbred C57BL and CNS neurodegenerative and estrogen and extragonadal organ and membrane lymphotoxin and phenotype change",eng,1469-221X (Print) 1469-221x,e54228,24,36633157,"Department of Comparative Biosciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA.

This protection was not reversible by systemic administration of high doses of IL-2.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of the disease, was used to address the role of T regulatory cells (Tregs) in the anti-CD52 mAb-induced suppression of the disease. In vitro studies on PBMCs from RRMS patients and matched healthy controls determined the effect of IL-7 on the expansion of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-) Tregs and induction of their suppressive phenotype. This study using EAE animal models of MS has shown that mouse anti-CD52 mAb suppression of clinical disease was augmented by coadministration of IL-7 and partially reversed by anti-IL-7 mAb. In vitro human studies showed that IL-7 induced expansion of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-) Tregs and increased their FOXP3, GITIR, CD46, CTLA-4, granzyme B, and perforin expression.

The effect was detected immediately after the treatment and maintained over long-term follow-up.

Three other FDA-approved S1PR modulators for MS-fingolimod, siponimod, and ozanimod-share peripheral immunological effects via common S1P(1) interactions, yet ponesimod may access distinct central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms through its selectivity for the S1P(1) receptor. Here, ponesimod was examined for S1PR internalization and binding, human astrocyte signaling and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) gene expression, and in vivo using murine cuprizone-mediated demyelination. Studies confirmed ponesimod's selectivity for S1P(1) without comparable engagement to the other S1PR subtypes (S1P(2,3,4,5) ). Ponesimod showed pharmacological properties of acute agonism followed by chronic functional antagonism of S1P(1) . A major locus of S1P(1) expression in the CNS is on astrocytes, and scRNA-seq of primary human astrocytes exposed to ponesimod identified a gene ontology relationship of reduced neuroinflammation and reduction in known astrocyte disease-related genes including those of immediate early astrocytes that have been strongly associated with disease progression in MS animal models. Remarkably, ponesimod prevented cuprizone-induced demyelination selectively in the cingulum, but not in the corpus callosum. These data support the CNS activities of ponesimod through S1P(1) , including protective, and likely selective, effects against demyelination in a major connection pathway of the brain, the limbic fibers of the cingulum, lesions of which have been associated with several neurologic impairments including MS fatigue.",10.1096/fj.202101531R,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202101531R,WZ,1,NA,cuprizone,mouse,C57BL/6,male,8,Ponesimod,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Kihara_2022_Fj,JOUR,2,"Animals and Astrocytes/drug effects/*metabolism and Cell Line, Tumor and Cells, Cultured and Central Nervous System/*drug effects/metabolism and Humans and Male and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Neuroinflammatory Diseases/*drug therapy/*metabolism and Protective Agents/*pharmacology and Signal Transduction/drug effects and Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors/*metabolism and Thiazoles/*pharmacology and Gpcr and lysophospholipid and multiple sclerosis and neuroinflammation and sphingolipid",eng,0892-6638 (Print) 0892-6638,e22132,36,34986275,"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, Translational Neuroscience Initiative, La Jolla, California, USA.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of S1P receptors in a non-T-cell model of demyelination, the cuprizone (cupr) model in C57BL/6 mice. Treatment with FTY720 (1 mg/kg) led to attenuated injury to OLGs, myelin, and axons in the corpus callosum (percentage of myelinated fibers was 44.7% in cupr-water and 63% in cupr-FTY720). Reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis were ameliorated when FTY720 was given from d 1, but astrogliosis was augmented when FTY720 was given from wk 4-9. FTY720 did not promote remyelination in this model. The protective effect of FTY720 was associated with decreased interleukin-1<ce><b2> and CCL2 transcripts in the corpus callosum, as well as altered S1P1 expression. Targeted deletion of S1P1 in OLG lineage cells did not lead to obvious clinical phenotype, but resulted in subtle abnormalities in myelin and an increased susceptibility to cupr-induced demyelination. We conclude that S1P receptors expressed by neuroglia are involved in regulating the response to injury, and CNS effects of FTY720 could contribute to its favorable therapeutic response in multiple sclerosis.",10.1096/fj.10-173203,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.10-173203,WZ,1,NA,cuprizone,mouse,C57BL/6,male,6.5,Fingolimod,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,download of paper not possible (no PDF available),Kim_2011_Fj,JOUR,5,"Animals and Axons/drug effects/metabolism and Blotting, Western and Corpus Callosum/cytology/drug effects/metabolism and Cuprizone/*toxicity and Demyelinating Diseases/chemically induced/drug therapy and Fingolimod Hydrochloride and Immunohistochemistry and Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology and Interleukin-1beta/metabolism and Male and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Knockout and Microscopy, Electron and Myelin Sheath/drug effects/metabolism and Oligodendroglia/drug effects/metabolism and Propylene Glycols/pharmacology/therapeutic use and Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/genetics/*metabolism and Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction and Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use",eng,0892-6638 (Print) 0892-6638,1509-18,25,21248243,"Department of Neurology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.",NA,NA,NA,PMC3079302,May,NLM,1093,"ASReview_relevant and 1530-6860 and Kim, Hye Jung and Miron, Veronique E and Dukala, Danuta and Proia, Richard L and Ludwin, Samuel K and Traka, Maria and Antel, Jack P and Soliven, Betty and R21 NS049014/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States and CAPMC/CIHR/Canada and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2011/01/21 and FASEB J. 2011 May;25(5):1509-18. doi: 10.1096/fj.10-173203.

Multiple sclerosis is induced through multiple mechanisms and is caused by inflammation and demyelination. This study aims to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of swimming exercise in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rats, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. METHODS: EAE was induced by an intradermal injection of 50-<ce><bc>g purified myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 33-55 (MOG33-55) dissolved in 200-<ce><bc>L saline at the base of the tail. The rats in the swimming exercise group were made to swim for 30 minutes once pert a day for 26 consecutive days, starting 5 days after induction of EAE. To compare the effect of swimming exercise with interferon-<ce><b2>, a drug for multiple sclerosis, interferon-<ce><b2> was injected intraperitoneally into rats of the EAE-induced and interferon-<ce><b2>-treated group during the exercise period. RESULTS: Injection of MOG33-55 caused weight loss, decreased clinical disability score, and increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators in the lumbar spinal cord. Loss of motor function and weakness increased demyelination score. Swimming exercise suppressed demyelination and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators. These changes promoted recovery of EAE symptoms such as body weight loss, motor dysfunction, and weakness. Swimming exercise caused the same level of improvement as interferon-<ce><b2> treatment. CONCLUSION: The results of this experiment suggest the possibility of swimming exercise in urological diseases that are difficult to treat. Swimming exercises can be considered for relief of symptom in incurable multiple sclerosis.",10.5213/inj.2040156.078,https://doi.org/10.5213/inj.2040156.078,WZ,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,female,9,Interferon Beta 1,control,1,40,1,1.1,8,0.2,2.5,8,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Kim_2020_INJ,JOUR,Suppl 1,Demyelination and Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and Inflammation and Multiple sclerosis and Swimming exercise,eng,2093-4777 (Print) 2093-4777,S39-47,24,32482056,"Department of Exercise Rehabilitation & Welfare, Gachon University, Incheon, Korea.

However, the specific subtype of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors that mediates the effect of FTY720 on the CNS cells has not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) is elevated in reactive astrocytes in an autoimmunity independent mouse model of MS and that selective S1PR1 modulation is sufficient to ameliorate the loss of oligodendrocytes and demyelination. The non-selective S1PR modulator, FTY720, or a short-lived S1PR1-specific modulator, CYM5442, was administered daily to mice while on cuprizone diet. Both FTY720- and CYM5422-treated mice displayed a significant reduction in oligodendrocyte apoptosis and astrocyte and microglial activation in comparison to vehicle-treated groups, which was associated with decreased production of proinflammatory mediators and down-regulation of astrocytic S1PR1 protein. Interestingly, S1PR1 modulation during the early phase of cuprizone intoxication was required to suppress oligodendrocyte death and consequent demyelination as drug treatment from 10 days after the initiation of cuprizone feeding was no longer effective. CYM5442 treatment during the brief cuprizone exposure significantly prevented Il-1<ce><b2>, Il-6, Cxcl10, and Cxcl3 induction, resulting in suppression of subsequent reactive gliosis and demyelination. Our study identifies functional antagonism of S1PR1 as a major mechanism for the protective effect of FTY720 in the cuprizone model and suggests pathogenic contributions of astrocyte S1PR1 signaling in primary demyelination and its potential as a therapeutic target for CNS inflammation.",10.1002/glia.23272,https://doi.org/10.1002/glia.23272,WZ,1,NA,cuprizone,mouse,C57BL/6,male,8.5,Fingolimod,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Kim_2018_Glia,JOUR,3,"Animals and Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology and Brain/drug effects/metabolism/pathology and Chimera and Cuprizone and Demyelinating Diseases/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology and Disease Models, Animal and Fingolimod Hydrochloride/*pharmacology and Gene Expression/drug effects and Gliosis/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology and Indans/pharmacology and Inflammation/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology and Male and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Transgenic and Neuroglia/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology and Neuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology and Oxadiazoles/pharmacology and Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism and Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors and White Matter/drug effects/metabolism/pathology and astrocytes and S1p and fingolimod and gliosis and multiple sclerosis and neuroinflammation",eng,0894-1491 (Print) 0894-1491,654-669,66,29193293,"Department of Veterinary Integrative Biosciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, 77843.

R.",1999,Neurology,Estriol ameliorates autoimmune demyelinating disease: implications for multiple sclerosis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of estriol in the treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and other cell mediated autoimmune diseases. BACKGROUND: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is a T helper 1 (Th1)-mediated autoimmune demyelinating disease that is a useful model for the study of immune responses in MS. Interestingly, both EAE and MS have been shown to be ameliorated during late pregnancy. METHODS: Estriol, progesterone, and placebo pellets were implanted in mice during the effector phase of adoptive EAE. Disease scores were compared between treatment groups, and autoantigen-specific humoral and cellular responses were examined. RESULTS: Estriol treatment reduced the severity of EAE significantly compared with placebo treatment whereas progesterone treatment had no effect. Estriol doses that induced serum estriol levels that approximated estriol levels during late pregnancy were capable of ameliorating disease. Estriol-treated EAE mice had significantly higher levels of serum antibodies of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 isotype specific for the autoantigen myelin basic protein (MBP). Further, MBP-specific T-lymphocyte responses from estriol-treated EAE mice were characterized by significantly increased production of the Th2 cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10). T lymphocytes were shown to be the primary source of IL-10 within antigen-stimulated splenocyte populations.

The double transgenic mouse model spontaneous opticospinal encephalomyelitis (OSE), based on recombinant myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein(35-55) reactive T and B cells, mimicks features of chronic inflammation and degeneration in MS and related disorders. Here, we investigated the effects of prophylactic GA treatment on the clinical course, histological alterations and peripheral immune cells in OSE. Objective: To investigate the effects of prophylactic glatiramer acetate (GA) treatment in a mouse model of spontaneous opticospinal encephalomyelitis (OSE). Methods: OSE mice with a postnatal age of 21 to 28 days without signs of encephalomyelitis were treated once daily either with 150 <c2><b5>g GA or vehicle intraperitoneally (i. p.). The animals were scored daily regarding clinical signs and weight. The animals were sacrificed after 30 days of treatment or after having reached a score of 7.0 due to animal care guidelines. We performed immunohistochemistry of spinal cord sections and flow cytometry analysis of immune cells. Results: Preventive treatment with 150 <c2><b5>g GA i. p. once daily significantly reduced clinical disease progression with a mean score of 3.9 <c2><b1> 1.0 compared to 6.2 <c2><b1> 0.7 in control animals (p < 0.01) after 30 d in accordance with positive effects on weight (p < 0.001). The immunohistochemistry showed that general inflammation, demyelination or CD11c(+) dendritic cell infiltration did not differ. There was, however, a modest reduction of the Iba1(+) area (p < 0.05) and F4/80(+) area upon GA treatment (p < 0.05). The immune cell composition of secondary lymphoid organs showed a trend towards an upregulation of regulatory T cells, which lacked significance. Conclusions: Preventive treatment with GA reduces disease progression in OSE in line with modest effects on microglia/macrophages. Due to the lack of established prophylactic treatment options for chronic autoimmune diseases with a high risk of disability, our study could provide valuable indications for translational medicine.",10.3390/cells12040542,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12040542,WZ,1,NA,OSE,mouse,"TCRMOG, IghMOG",both,3.5,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,38,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Koc_2023_Cell,JOUR,4,"Mice and Animals and Glatiramer Acetate/therapeutic use and *Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/pathology and Peptides/pharmacology and Inflammation/drug therapy and Mice, Transgenic and *Encephalomyelitis/drug therapy and Disease Progression and Nmosd and Ose and chronic inflammatory CNS disorders and immunomodulation and progressive multiple sclerosis",eng,2073-4409,NA,12,36831209,"Department of Neurology, St. Josef-Hospital, Ruhr-University Bochum, Gudrunstr. 56, 44791 Bochum, Germany.",NA,NA,"Ãœ.K., S.H., K.K. and S.D. have nothing to declare.

M.",2021,Front Immunol,"Immunomodulation Eliminates Inflammation in the Hippocampus in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis, but Does Not Ameliorate Anxiety-Like Behavior","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease targeting the central nervous system, characterized by an unpredictable disease course and a wide range of symptoms. Emotional and cognitive deficits are now recognized as primary disease manifestations and not simply the consequence of living with a chronic condition, raising questions regarding the efficacy of current therapeutics for these specific symptoms. Mechanisms underlying psychiatric sequelae in MS are believed to be similar to those underlying pathogenesis, that is mediated by cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of MS depression, we performed behavioral assays in the murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) MS model, in the presence or absence of immunomodulation using the drug FTY720, an analogue of the lipid signaling molecule sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Specifically, mice were challenged with the elevated plus maze (EPM) test, a validated experimental paradigm for rodent-specific anxiety-like behavior. FTY720 treatment failed to ameliorate anxiety-like symptoms, irrespective of dosage. On the other hand, it was effective in reducing inflammatory infiltration, microglial reactivity and levels of pro-inflammatory molecules in the hippocampus, confirming the anti-inflammatory capacity of treatment. To explore the absence of FTY720 effect on behavior, we confirmed expression of S1P receptors (S1PR) S1PR1, S1PR3 and S1PR5 in the hippocampus and mapped the dynamics of these receptors in response to drug treatment alone, or in combination with EAE induction. We identified a complex pattern of responses, differing between (1) receptors, (2) dosage and (3) hippocampal sub-field. FTY720 treatment in the absence of EAE resulted in overall downregulation of S1PR1 and S1PR3, while S1PR5 exhibited a dose-dependent upregulation. EAE induction alone resulted in overall downregulation of all three receptors. On the other hand, combined FTY720 and EAE showed generally no effect on S1PR1 and S1PR3 expression except for the fimbrium region, but strong upregulation of S1PR5 over the range of doses examined. These data illustrate a hitherto undescribed complexity of S1PR response to FTY720 in the hippocampus, independent of drug effect on effector immune cells, but simultaneously emphasize the need to explore novel treatment strategies to specifically address mood disorders in MS.",10.3389/fimmu.2021.639650,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.639650,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,TCRMOGxIgHMOG,female,14,Fingolimod,control,1,NA,1,0,8,0,2.3,8,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Kocovski_2021_FronImmu,JOUR,NA,"Animals and Anxiety/drug therapy/*immunology and Behavior, Animal/drug effects/*physiology and Disease Models, Animal and Down-Regulation/drug effects/immunology and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/drug therapy/*immunology and Female and Fingolimod Hydrochloride/pharmacology and Hippocampus/drug effects/*immunology and Immunomodulation/drug effects/*immunology and Inflammation/drug therapy/*immunology and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Microglia/drug effects/immunology and Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology and Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors/immunology and Up-Regulation/drug effects/immunology and EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) and EPM (elevated plus maze) and FTY720 (fingolimod) and S1pr and anxiety and major depression and hippocampus and immunomodulation and multiple sclerosis",eng,1664-3224,639650,12,34177891,"Department of Psychology and Counselling, School of Psychology and Public Health, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.

The levels of Sema4A in the sera were measured by sandwich ELISA. The implications of Sema4A on the efficacy of fingolimod were investigated by administering recombinant Sema4A-Fc and fingolimod to mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Retrospective analysis of MS cohort (17 high Sema4A and 39 low Sema4A) demonstrated the effectiveness of fingolimod in those with high serum Sema4A levels, showing reduction of ARR (from 1.21 to 0.12) and EDSS progression (from 0.50 to 0.04).

The model of demyelination was carried out by the administration of cuprizone to the drinking water of the experimental mice. Besides cuprizone, 4-AP derivatives and 4-AP were administered to the groups in order to assess their protective effect on the demyelination. We used immunohistochemistry for visualization of changes in corpus callosum. Memory storage processes were also assessed with the passive avoidance test on the last two days of the experiment. The experimental mice treated with compounds 4b and 4c increased significantly their latency time on the second day in comparison to the control group which indicated an improved memory process. The number of mature oligodendrocytes in the groups treated with compounds 4b, 4c and 4-AP is closer to those in the control group. The results of our studies showed that the newly synthesized compounds 4b and 4c reverse the effect of cuprizone.

M. and Teuscher, C.",2018,Front Immunol,Sex-Specific Gene-by-Vitamin D Interactions Regulate Susceptibility to Central Nervous System Autoimmunity,"Vitamin D3 (VitD) insufficiency is postulated to represent a major modifiable risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS). While low VitD levels strongly correlate with higher MS risk in white populations, this is not the case for other ethnic groups, suggesting the existence of a genetic component. Moreover, VitD supplementation studies in MS so far have not shown a consistent benefit. We sought to determine whether direct manipulation of VitD levels modulates central nervous system autoimmune disease in a sex-by-genotype-dependent manner. To this end, we used a dietary model of VitD modulation, together with the autoimmune animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). To assess the impact of genotype-by-VitD interactions on EAE susceptibility, we utilized a chromosome substitution (consomic) mouse model that incorporates the genetic diversity of wild-derived PWD/PhJ mice. High VitD was protective in EAE in female, but not male C57BL/6J (B6) mice, and had no effect in EAE-resistant PWD/PhJ (PWD) mice. EAE protection was accompanied by sex- and genotype-specific suppression of proinflammatory transcriptional programs in CD4 T effector cells, but not CD4 regulatory T cells. Decreased expression of proinflammatory genes was observed with high VitD in female CD4 T effector cells, specifically implicating a key role of MHC class II genes, interferon gamma, and Th1<e2><80><89>cell-mediated neuroinflammation. In consomic strains, effects of VitD on EAE were also sex- and genotype dependent, whereby high VitD: (1) was protective, (2) had no effect, and (3) unexpectedly had disease-exacerbating effects. Systemic levels of 25(OH)D differed across consomic strains, with higher levels associated with EAE protection only in females. Analysis of expression of key known VitD metabolism genes between B6 and PWD mice revealed that their expression is genetically determined and sex specific and implicated Cyp27b1 and Vdr as candidate genes responsible for differential EAE responses to VitD modulation. Taken together, our results support the observation that the association between VitD status and MS susceptibility is genotype dependent and suggest that the outcome of VitD status in MS is determined by gene-by-sex interactions.",10.3389/fimmu.2018.01622,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01622,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,"C57BL/6, PWD, C57BL/6.ChrPWD",both,9,Vitamin D3,control,1,209,0,1.3,24,0.3,1.9,33,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Scores obtained from B6 strain,Krementsov_2018_FronImmu,JOUR,NA,CD4 T cells and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and genetic variation and gene<e2><80><93>environment interactions and multiple sclerosis and sex differences and vitamin D and wild-derived inbred strains,eng,1664-3224 (Print) 1664-3224,1622,9,30065723,"Department of Biomedical and Health Sciences, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, United States.

This is owing to the long duration of disease induction and observation of treatment effects in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. We propose a novel adult zebrafish based model which offers a quick and simple protocol that can used to screen candidates as a step between in vitro experiments and rodent studies. The experiments conducted for this manuscript were to standardize a suitable model of EAE in adult zebrafish and validate it using known modulators. METHODS: The EAE model was developed by disease induction with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein - 35-55 (MOG) and observation of survival, clinical signs and body weight changes. We have validated this model using fingolimod. We have further performed detailed validation using dimethyl fumarate, dexamethasone and SR1001, which are known modulators of rodent EAE. RESULTS: The immunization dose for the disease induction was observed to be 0.6mg/ml of MOG in CFA (Complete Freund's adjuvant), injected subcutaneously (s.c.) near spinal vertebrae. In the validation study with fingolimod, we have demonstrated the modulation of disease symptoms, which were also confirmed by histopathological evaluation. Furthermore, detailed validation with three other known drugs showed that our observations concur with those reported in conventional rodent models. DISCUSSION: We have standardized and validated the adult zebrafish EAE model. This model can help get a quick idea of in vivo activity of drugs in a week using very low quantities of candidate compounds. Further work will be required to define this model particularly as it is found that zebrafish may not express a MOG homologue.",10.1016/j.msard.2016.11.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2016.11.010,WZ,1,NA,EAE,zebrafish,NA,NA,20,Fingolimod,control,NA,144,"1,2",1.1,12,0.1,3.8,12,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Kulkarni_2017_MultScleRelaDiso,JOUR,NA,"Animals and Dexamethasone/pharmacology and Dimethyl Fumarate/pharmacology and Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/*methods and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug and therapy/pathology/physiopathology and Fingolimod Hydrochloride/pharmacology and Immunologic Factors/pharmacology and Phenotype and Sulfonamides/pharmacology and Thiazoles/pharmacology and Video Recording and *Zebrafish and Drug Discovery and Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and Fingolimod (Gilenya) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and Zebrafish",eng,2211-0348,32-39,11,28104252,"Drug Discovery Research Laboratory, Department of Pharmacy, Birla Institute of Technology & Science-Pilani, Hyderabad Campus, Hyderabad-500078, India; Dr. Reddy's Institute of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad Campus, Gachibowli, Hyderabad-500046, India.

Here we show that amelioration of MS by dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a mechanistically elusive drug, associates with suppression of Tc17 cells. DMF treatment results in reduced frequency of Tc17, contrary to Th17 cells, and in a decreased ratio of the regulators RORC-to-TBX21, along with a shift towards cytotoxic T lymphocyte gene expression signature in CD8(+) T cells from MS patients. Mechanistically, DMF potentiates the PI3K-AKT-FOXO1-T-BET pathway, thereby limiting IL-17 and ROR<ce><b3>t expression as well as STAT5-signaling in a glutathione-dependent manner. This results in chromatin remodeling at the Il17 locus. Consequently, T-BET-deficiency in mice or inhibition of PI3K-AKT, STAT5 or reactive oxygen species prevents DMF-mediated Tc17 suppression.

Here we investigate effects of fingolimod on expression of astroglial glutamate transporters under pro-inflammatory conditions. In astrocyte cell culture, the addition of pro-inflammatory cytokines led to a significant downregulation of glutamate transporters glutamate transporter-1 (slc1a2/SLC1A2) and glutamate aspartate transporter (slc1a3/SLC1A3) expression on the mRNA or protein level. In this setting, the direct application of fingolimod-1 phosphate (F1P) on astrocytes did not change expression levels of slc1a2 and slc1a3 mRNA. The analysis of both transporters on the protein level by Western Blot and immunocytochemistry did also not reveal any effect of F1P. On a functional level, the addition of conditioned supernatants from F1P treated astrocytes to neuronal cell culture did not result in increased neurite growth. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis as a model of multiple sclerosis, fingolimod treatment reduced T cell and macrophages/microglia mediated inflammation and also diminished astrocyte activation. At the same time, fingolimod restored the reduced expression of slc1a2 and slc1a3 in the inflamed spinal cord on the mRNA level and of SLC1A2 and SLC1A3 on the protein level, presumably via indirect, anti-inflammatory mechanisms.

S.",2011,Journal of Neuroinflammation,Anti-CD20 B-cell depletion enhances monocyte reactivity in neuroimmunological disorders,"Background: Clinical trials evaluating anti-CD20-mediated B-cell depletion in multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) generated encouraging results. Our recent studies in the MS model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) attributed clinical benefit to extinction of activated B-cells, but cautioned that depletion of na<c3><af>ve B-cells may be undesirable. We elucidated the regulatory role of un-activated B-cells in EAE and investigated whether anti-CD20 may collaterally diminish regulatory B-cell properties in treatment of neuroimmunological disorders.Methods: Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide-immunized C57Bl/6 mice were depleted of B-cells. Functional consequences for regulatory T-cells (Treg) and cytokine production of CD11b+ antigen presenting cells (APC) were assessed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 22 patients receiving anti-CD20 and 23 untreated neuroimmunological patients were evaluated for frequencies of B-cells, T-cells and monocytes; monocytic reactivity was determined by TNF-production and expression of signalling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM).Results: We observed that EAE-exacerbation upon depletion of un-activated B-cells closely correlated with an enhanced production of pro-inflammatory TNF by CD11b+ APC. Paralleling this pre-clinical finding, anti-CD20 treatment of human neuroimmunological disorders increased the relative frequency of monocytes and accentuated pro-inflammatory monocyte function; when reactivated ex vivo, a higher frequency of monocytes from B-cell depleted patients produced TNF and expressed the activation marker SLAM.Conclusions: These data suggest that in neuroimmunological disorders, pro-inflammatory APC activity is controlled by a subset of B-cells which is eliminated concomitantly upon anti-CD20 treatment. While this observation does not conflict with the general concept of B-cell depletion in human autoimmunity, it implies that its safety and effectiveness may further advance by selectively targeting pathogenic B-cell function. <c2><a9> 2011 Lehmann-Horn et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1742-2094-8-146,https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-8-146,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,NA,Rituximab,control,2,NA,0,2.7,5,0.5,1.3,5,0.6,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Lehmann.Horn_2011_JoofNe,JOUR,NA,CD11b antigen and CD20 antibody and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and rituximab and signaling lymphocyte activation molecule associated protein and tumor necrosis factor and adult and aged and autoimmune encephalomyelitis and animal experiment and animal model and antigen presenting cell and article and humoral immune deficiency and B lymphocyte and controlled study and cytokine production and disease exacerbation and disease severity and ex vivo study and female and human and lymphocyte depletion and male and monocyte and mouse and multiple sclerosis and myelooptic neuropathy and nonhuman and peripheral blood mononuclear cell and regulatory T lymphocyte,English,1742-2094,NA,8,NA,"M.S.

However, the role of S1P receptors on monocytes is less clear. To elucidate this, we systematically evaluated monocytes in rats and mice, both in naive and inflammatory conditions, with S1P receptor modulators FTY720 and BAF312. We demonstrate that S1P receptor modulators reduce circulating monocytes in a similar time course as lymphocytes. Furthermore, total monocyte numbers were increased in the spleen and bone marrow, suggesting that S1P receptor modulation restricts egress from hematopoietic organs. Monocytes treated ex vivo with FTY720 had reduced CD40 expression and TNF-<ce><b1> production, suggesting a direct effect on monocyte activation. Similar reductions in protein expression and cytokine production were also found in vivo. Suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice and rats by FTY720 correlated with reduced numbers of lymphocytes and monocytes. These effects on monocytes were independent of S1P3, as treatment with BAF312, a S1P1,4,5 modulator, led to similar results.

However, therapy response may be less than optimal due to demyelination and axonal damage caused by myeloid cells. Purpose To determine if myeloperoxidase (MPO) molecular MRI can evaluate whether combination therapy targeting both lymphoid and myeloid inflammation can improve autoimmune neuroinflammation compared with either drug alone, even at suboptimal doses. Materials and Methods Four groups of 94 female mice (8-10 weeks old) were induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) from August 2, 2016, to March 30, 2018, and divided into saline control (n = 22), 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH) therapy group (n = 19), glatiramer acetate (GA) therapy group (n = 22), and combination therapy group (n = 31). Mice were administered suboptimal doses of ABAH, an irreversible inhibitor of MPO; GA, a first-line multiple sclerosis drug; both ABAH and GA; or saline (control). Mice were imaged with bis-5-hydroxytryptamide-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate gadolinium (hereafter, MPO-Gd) MRI. One-way analysis of variance, two-way analysis of variance, Kurskal-Wallis, and log-rank tests were used. P < .05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Results The combination-treated group showed delayed disease onset (day 11.3 vs day 9.8 for ABAH, day 10.4 for GA, day 9.9 for control; P < .05) and reduced disease severity (clinical score during the acute exacerbation period of 1.8 vs 3.8 for ABAH, 3.1 for GA, 3.9 for control; P < .05). The combination-treated group demonstrated fewer MPO-positive lesions (30.2 vs 73.7 for ABAH, 64.8 for GA, 67.2 for control; P < .05), smaller MPO-positive lesion volume (16.7 mm(3) vs 65.2 mm(3) for ABAH, 69.9 mm(3) for GA, 66.0 mm(3) for control; P < .05), and lower intensity of MPO-Gd lesion activation ratio (0.7 vs 1.9 for ABAH, 3.2 for GA, 2.3 for control; P < .05). Reduced disease severity in the combination group was confirmed at histopathologic analysis, where MPO expression (1779 vs 2673 for ABAH, 2898 for GA; P < .05) and demyelination (5.3% vs 9.0% for ABAH, 10.6% for GA; P < .05) were ameliorated. Conclusion Myeloperoxidase molecular MRI can track the treatment response from immunomodulatory drugs even if the drug does not directly target myeloperoxidase, and establishes that combination therapy targeting both myeloid and lymphocytic inflammation is effective for murine autoimmune neuroinflammation, even at suboptimal doses. <c2><a9> RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

We sought in this study to determine whether the anti-immune/anti-inflammatory action of 1,25(OH)2D3 is in part mediated through an interplay between 1,25(OH)2D3 and toll-like receptor (TLR)7/8 signaling. 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment prior to and/or following experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induction effectively reduced inflammatory cytokine expression in the spinal cord and ameliorated EAE. These effects were accompanied with a reduction in expression of several TLRs with the most profound effect observed for TLR8. The expression of TLR8 adaptor protein MyD88 was also significantly reduced by 1,25(OH)2D3. To determine the molecular mechanism by which 1,25(OH)2D3 suppresses EAE induction of TLR8 and inflammatory cytokine expression, we evaluated whether 1,25(OH)2D3 can directly inhibit TLR8 signaling and the resulting inflammatory responses in human THP-1 monocytes. 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment not only significantly reduced TLR8 expression but also the expression or activity of MyD88, IRF-4, IRF-7 and NF-kB in monocytes challenged with TLR8 ligands. TLR8 promoter-luciferase reporter assays indicated that 1,25(OH)2D3 decreases TLR8 mRNA level in part via inhibiting TLR8 gene transcription activity. As a result of inhibition on TLR8 signaling cascade at various stages, 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly diminished the TLR8 target gene expression (TNF-<ce><b1> and IL-1<ce><b2>). In summary, our novel findings suggest that TLR8 is a new target of 1,25(OH)2D3 and may mediate the anti-inflammatory action of 1,25(OH)2D3. Our findings also point to a destructive role of TLR8 in EAE and shed lights on pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. <c2><a9> 2013 Li et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0058808,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058808,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,10,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,"0,1",0.3,4.5,0.2,2,4.5,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Li_2013_PLoONE,JOUR,3,calcitriol and immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein and interferon regulatory factor 4 and interferon regulatory factor 7 and messenger RNA and myeloid differentiation factor 88 and toll like receptor 8 and animal cell and animal experiment and animal model and animal tissue and antiinflammatory activity and article and controlled study and drug mechanism and drug targeting and female and gene expression and human and human cell and in vitro study and in vivo study and inflammatory cell and inflammatory infiltrate and molecular pathology and mouse and multiple sclerosis and nonhuman and protein expression and signal transduction and toll like receptor 8 gene,English,1932-6203,NA,8,NA,"X.

Several recent studies indicate that components of the inflammatory response to demyelination may be beneficial for the regenerative process of remyelination. In this study we examined the effects of minocycline on remyelination independent of its effects in limiting immune-mediated white matter damage using a toxin model of demyelination. Demyelinating lesions were induced by injection of ethidium bromide into caudal cerebellar peduncles of adult rats. Minocycline or PBS was administered by twice daily injections from day 1 prior to lesion-induction to post lesion day 3. Remyelination was assessed, blinded to grouping, using standard morphological criteria. The microglia activation within the lesion was assessed by examining the expression of OX-42 and major histocompatibility class II immunoreactivity. The oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) response was quantified by in situ hybridization using probes for OPC-expressed mRNAs, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha and Olig-1. Minocycline treatment strongly inhibited microglia/macrophage activation at day 1 and day 3 post-lesion induction, and suppressed the OPC response to demyelination. We also found a significant decrease in the extent of oligodendrocyte but not Schwann cell remyelination in the minocycline-treated animals as compared with controls at 3 weeks post-lesion induction. These results indicate that microglia/macrophage activation is an important process for remyelination and further support the concept that suppression of inflammatory response may impair remyelination.",10.1016/j.jneuroim.2004.08.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2004.08.011,WZ,1,NA,ethidium bromide,rat,Sprague-Dawley,female,9.5,Minocycline,control,3,54,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Li_2005_JN,JOUR,44958,"Animals and Animals, Newborn and Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use and Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism and CD11b Antigen/metabolism and Cell Count and Cells, Cultured and Cerebellum/metabolism and Demyelinating Diseases/chemically induced/*drug therapy/metabolism and *Disease Models, Animal and Dose-Response Relationship, Drug and Ethidium and Female and Fluorescent Antibody Technique/methods and Genes, MHC Class II/physiology and In Situ Hybridization/methods and Microglia/*drug effects and Minocycline/*therapeutic use and Oligodendroglia/*drug effects and Rats and Staining and Labeling/methods and Stem Cells/drug effects and Time Factors",eng,0165-5728 (Print) 0165-5728,58-66,158,15589038,"Cambridge Centre for Brain Repair and Neuroregeneration Laboratory, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Madingley Road, Cambridge CB3 0ES, UK.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Jan,NLM,1438,"ASReview_relevant and Li, Wen-Wu and Setzu, Anna and Zhao, Chao and Franklin, Robin J M and 689/MSS_/Multiple Sclerosis Society/United Kingdom and Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Netherlands and 2004/12/14 and J Neuroimmunol. 2005 Jan;158(1-2):58-66. doi: 10.1016/j.jneuroim.2004.08.011.",Minocycline-mediated inhibition of microglia activation impairs oligodendrocyte progenitor cell responses and remyelination in a non-immune model of demyelination,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,243

Here, we show that dimethyl fumarate exerts a profound alteration of the metabolic profile of human CD4+ as well as CD8+ T cells and restricts their antioxidative capacities by decreasing intracellular levels of the reactive oxygen species scavenger glutathione. This causes an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels accompanied by an enhanced mitochondrial stress response, ultimately leading to impaired mitochondrial function. Enhanced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels not only result in enhanced T-cell apoptosis in vitro as well as in dimethyl fumarate-treated patients, but are key for the well-known immunomodulatory effects of dimethyl fumarate both in vitro and in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, i.e. experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Indeed, dimethyl fumarate immune-modulatory effects on T cells were completely abrogated by pharmacological interference of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. These data shed new light on dimethyl fumarate as bona fide immune-metabolic drug that targets the intracellular stress response in activated T cells, thereby restricting mitochondrial function and energetic capacity, providing novel insight into the role of oxidative stress in modulating cellular immune responses and T cell-mediated autoimmunity.",10.1093/brain/awab307,https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awab307,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,both,11,Dimethyl fumarate,control,NA,NA,0,1.8,10.5,0.1,4,10.5,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Liebmann_2021_Brai,JOUR,10,"Adult and Animals and Antioxidants/*pharmacology/therapeutic use and Autoimmunity/*drug effects/physiology and CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/physiology and CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/physiology and Cohort Studies and Dimethyl Fumarate/*pharmacology/therapeutic use and Female and Humans and Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use and Male and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Middle Aged and Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism and Young Adult and T-cell and antioxidative T-cell<c2><a0>capacities and autoimmunity and dimethyl fumarate and multiple sclerosis and metabolism",eng,0006-8950 (Print) 0006-8950,3126-3141,144,34849598,"Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital of MÃ¼nster, MÃ¼nster 48149, Germany.

The use of a preclinical animal model, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) has deepened our knowledge of the immunomodulatory functions of TnP as a drug. We have shown that TnP possesses a disease suppressive function in EAE, ameliorating disease severity by 40% and suppressing the accumulation of T helper (Th)1- and Th17-producing lymphocytes (by 55% and 60%, respectively) in CNS along with activated microglia/macrophages populations (by 33% and 50%, respectively), and also conferred a protective effect anticipating the remyelination process to day 66 compared to day 83 of untreated cuprizone-mice. Here we expanded our knowledge about its effects compared with current first-line disease-modifying therapies (DMT). We demonstrated that prophylactic treatment with TnP generated similar protection to betaseron (30%) or was more effective than glatiramer (44% versus 6%) or fingolimod (50% versus 19%) against the development of clinical symptoms. Although TnP controlled the leukocyte infiltration (87% versus 82%) into demyelinated areas of the spinal cord in the same way as betaseron and fingolimod, it was more effective (72% to 78% decrease) in the long-term control of neuronal degeneration compared to them. Also, when compared to glatiramer, TnP was more efficient in reversing leukocytes infiltration into the spinal cord (55% versus 24%), as well as induced a higher percentage of regulatory cells in spleen (2.9-fold versus 2.3-fold increase over vehicle-treated EAE mice) an in the spinal cord (8-fold versus 6-fold increase over vehicle-treated EAE mice).

Thus, novel therapeutics enhancing cellular resistance to free radicals could prove useful for multiple sclerosis treatment. BG00012 is an oral formulation of dimethylfumarate. In a phase II multiple sclerosis trial, BG00012 demonstrated beneficial effects on relapse rate and magnetic resonance imaging markers indicative of inflammation as well as axonal destruction. First we have studied effects of dimethylfumarate on the disease course, central nervous system, tissue integrity and the molecular mechanism of action in an animal model of chronic multiple sclerosis: myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in C57BL/6 mice. In the chronic phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, preventive or therapeutic application of dimethylfumarate ameliorated the disease course and improved preservation of myelin, axons and neurons. In vitro, the application of fumarates increased murine neuronal survival and protected human or rodent astrocytes against oxidative stress. Application of dimethylfumarate led to stabilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2, activation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2-dependent transcriptional activity and accumulation of NADP(H) quinoline oxidoreductase-1 as a prototypical target gene. Furthermore, the immediate metabolite of dimethylfumarate, monomethylfumarate, leads to direct modification of the inhibitor of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, at cysteine residue 151. In turn, increased levels of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 and reduced protein nitrosylation were detected in the central nervous sytem of dimethylfumarate-treated mice. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 was also upregulated in the spinal cord of autopsy specimens from untreated patients with multiple sclerosis. In dimethylfumarate-treated mice suffering from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, increased immunoreactivity for nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 was detected by confocal microscopy in neurons of the motor cortex and the brainstem as well as in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. In mice deficient for nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 on the same genetic background, the dimethylfumarate mediated beneficial effects on clinical course, axon preservation and astrocyte activation were almost completely abolished thus proving the functional relevance of this transcription factor for the neuroprotective mechanism of action. We conclude that the ability of dimethylfumarate to activate nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 may offer a novel cytoprotective modality that further augments the natural antioxidant responses in multiple sclerosis tissue and is not yet targeted by other multiple sclerosis therapies.",10.1093/brain/awq386,https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awq386,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,10,Dimethyl fumarate,control,1,NA,1,2.6,7,0.1,4,7,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Linker_2011_Brai,JOUR,Pt 3,"2',3'-Cyclic-Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases/metabolism and Aldehyde Reductase/metabolism and Animals and Antigens, Differentiation/metabolism and Antioxidants/metabolism and Astrocytes/drug effects/immunology and Axons/metabolism/pathology and CD3 Complex/metabolism and Cell Proliferation/drug effects and Cells, Cultured and Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods and Cytokines/metabolism and Disease Models, Animal and Embryo, Mammalian and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/etiology/*prevention & control and Female and Fumarates/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects and Glycoproteins/adverse effects and Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics and Humans and Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology and Mass Spectrometry and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Motor Neurons/cytology/drug effects/metabolism and Multiple Sclerosis/metabolism/pathology and Myelin Proteins/metabolism and Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein and NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/metabolism and NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolism and Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Nogo Proteins and Oxidative Stress/drug effects and Peptide Fragments/adverse effects and RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology and Signal Transduction/*drug effects and Sleep/physiology and Spinal Cord/cytology and Statistics, Nonparametric and Tandem Mass Spectrometry/methods and Time Factors and Transfection",eng,0006-8950,678-92,134,21354971,"Department of Neurology, St Josef Hospital, Ruhr-University Bochum, D-44791 Bochum, Germany. ralf.linker@rub.de",NA,NA,NA,NA,Mar,NLM,1082,"ASReview_relevant and 1460-2156 and Linker, Ralf A and Lee, De-Hyung and Ryan, Sarah and van Dam, Anne M and Conrad, Rebecca and Bista, Pradeep and Zeng, Weike and Hronowsky, Xiaoping and Buko, Alex and Chollate, Sowmya and Ellrichmann, Gisa and Br<c3><bc>ck, Wolfgang and Dawson, Kate and Goelz, Susan and Wiese, Stefan and Scannevin, Robert H and Lukashev, Matvey and Gold, Ralf and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and England and 2011/03/01 and Brain. 2011 Mar;134(Pt 3):678-92. doi: 10.1093/brain/awq386.",Fumaric acid esters exert neuroprotective effects in neuroinflammation via activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Marketed,NA,247

Here, we have investigated whether oral tolerance is dependent on endogenous IFN-beta by feeding low-dose self-antigen myelin basic protein to IFN-beta(-/-) mice with subsequent induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our study shows that oral tolerance was readily induced in IFN-beta(-/-) mice compared with their wild-type littermates (IFN-beta(+/+)). The non-self-antigen ovalbumin induced oral tolerance in both groups. These data indicate that endogenous IFN-beta is not required for induction of oral tolerance, whereas delivery of recombinant IFN-beta results in significant reduction in clinical score of EAE. Oral tolerance induction was associated with lower production of antigen-specific IFN-gamma, no shift toward antigen-specific Th2, Th17 or TGF-beta response was observed. Oral tolerance in IFN-beta(-/-) mice was also associated with the induction of regulatory and memory T cells in the mucosal-associated immune organs, however this was not a prerequisite for establishment of oral tolerance.",10.1038/icb.2009.111,https://doi.org/10.1038/icb.2009.111,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,both,14.5,Interferon Beta 1,control,1,NA,1,NA,6,NA,NA,6,NA,mean,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Liu_2010_ImmuCellBiol,JOUR,4,"Administration, Oral and Animals and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology and Eosinophil Major Basic Protein/*immunology/pharmacology and Immune Tolerance and Interferon-beta/genetics/immunology/*pharmacology and Mice and Mice, Knockout and Recombinant Proteins/genetics/immunology/*pharmacology",eng,0818-9641,468-76,88,20066002,"Neuroinflammation Unit, Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.",NA,NA,NA,NA,May-Jun,NLM,1161,"ASReview_relevant and 1440-1711 and Liu, Yawei and Teige, Ingrid and Ericsson, Ida and Navikas, Vaidrius and Issazadeh-Navikas, Shohreh and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2010/01/13 and Immunol Cell Biol. 2010 May-Jun;88(4):468-76. doi: 10.1038/icb.2009.111.

250,"LoPresti, P.",2015,Neurochem Res,Glatiramer acetate guards against rapid memory decline during relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,"Cognitive decline presents a therapeutic challenge for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease characterized by recurrent autoimmune demyelination and by progressive CNS degeneration. Glatiramer acetate (GA, also known as Copolymer 1, Cop-1, or Copaxone), commonly used to treat MS, reduces the frequency of relapses; it has both anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. However, clinical trials have not definitively shown that GA improves cognitive impairment during MS. Using an in vivo animal model of autoimmune demyelination, i.e., relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we tested short-term memory in EAE mice (EAE), in EAE mice treated with GA for 10 days starting at the time of immunization (EAE + GA), and in age-matched healthy, na<c3><af>ve mice (Na<c3><af>ve). Short-term memory was assessed using the cross-maze test at 10, 20, and 30 days post-immunization (d.p.i.); data were analyzed at each time point and over time. At 10 d.p.i., EAE and EAE + GA mice had better memory function than Na<c3><af>ve mice. However, at the later time points, EAE mice had a steep negative slope of memory function (indicating decline), whereas EAE + GA mice had a flatter, less-negative slope of memory function. Notably, the memory function of EAE mice significantly decreased over time compared with that of Na<c3><af>ve mice, indicating that EAE had a negative impact on cognitive ability. In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference between the slopes of memory function in mice with EAE treated with GA versus Na<c3><af>ve mice, which revealed effective, albeit partial, protection by GA treatment against progressive memory decline during EAE disease. Of particular interest, although EAE mice had memory decline over 30 d.p.i., their clinical disease scores improved during that time. Thus, our results suggest that EAE mice had a significant progressive memory decline and that GA, administered at the time of immunization, partially guards against rapid memory decline.",10.1007/s11064-014-1491-z,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11064-014-1491-z,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,NA,9,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,29,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,LoPresti_2015_NeuRes,JOUR,3,"Animals and Mice and Dose-Response Relationship, Drug and *Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/complications/drug therapy and *Glatiramer Acetate/therapeutic use and Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use and *Memory Disorders/etiology/prevention & control and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Time Factors and Multiple Sclerosis",eng,0364-3190,473-9,40,25481047,"Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA, lopresti@uic.edu.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Mar,NLM,759,"ASReview_relevant and 1573-6903 and LoPresti, Patrizia and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2014/12/08 and Neurochem Res. 2015 Mar;40(3):473-9. doi: 10.1007/s11064-014-1491-z.

An approach to improve MS treatment is to identify a rational combination of new medications or existing therapies that impact different aspects of the disease process. Statins are effective in the treatment of MS animal models and are promising candidates for future treatment. Minocycline ameliorates clinical severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and exhibits several anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities. In this study, we tested whether the combination of these two drugs could produce beneficial effects in EAE mice immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG). Our findings show that combined treatment, compared to using the medications alone, resulted in a significant reduction in disease severity, in both the acute and chronic phases of the disease, along with attenuation of inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. Stereological analysis revealed that the combined treatment significantly guarded against neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Moreover, a significant suppression of anti-MOG antibody production in animals treated with the two medications was found.

Glatiramer acetate (GA) and interferon-<ce><b2>-1b (IFN-<ce><b2>-1b) are two immunomodulatory agents that have been shown to decrease the frequency of MS relapses. However, the question of whether these substances can slow neurodegeneration in MS patients is the subject of controversy. In a rat model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, we investigated the effects of GA and IFN-<ce><b2>-1b on the survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the neurons that form the axons of the optic nerve. For each substance, therapy was started 14 days before immunization, on the day of immunization, or on the day of clinical disease onset. After myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis became clinically manifest, optic neuritis was monitored by recording visual evoked potentials. The function of RGCs was measured by electroretinograms. Although early GA or IFN-<ce><b2>-1b treatment showed benefit on disease activity, only treatment with GA exerted protective effects on RGCs, as revealed by measuring neurodegeneration and neuronal function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this GA-induced neuroprotection does not exclusively depend on the reduction of inflammatory infiltrates within the optic nerve.

Available therapies mainly target the inflammatory component of the disease but fail to prevent neurodegeneration. To investigate the effect of minocycline on the survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the neurons that form the axons of the optic nerve, we used a rat model of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Optic neuritis in this model was diagnosed by recording visual evoked potentials and RGC function was monitored by measuring electroretinograms. Functional and histopathological data of RGCs and optic nerves revealed neuronal and axonal protection when minocycline treatment was started on the day of immunization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that minocycline-induced neuroprotection is related to a direct antagonism of multiple mechanisms leading to neuronal cell death such as the induction of anti-apoptotic intracellular signalling pathways and a decrease in glutamate excitotoxicity. From these observations, we conclude that minocycline exerts neuroprotective effects independent of its anti-inflammatory properties. This hypothesis was confirmed in a non-inflammatory disease model leading to degeneration of RGCs, the surgical transection of the optic nerve.",10.1016/j.nbd.2006.10.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2006.10.022,WZ,1,NA,EAE,rat,Brown Norway,female,9,Minocycline,control,1,24,"1,2",1.4,8,0.3,3,8,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Maier_2007_NeuDis,JOUR,3,"Acute Disease and Animals and Anti-Bacterial Agents/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/pharmacology and Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology and Cell Survival/drug effects/immunology and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug and therapy/*immunology/physiopathology and Evoked Potentials, Visual and Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 1/metabolism and Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2/metabolism and Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 3/metabolism and Female and Glutamic Acid/metabolism and Minocycline/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacology and Myelin Proteins and Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein/immunology and Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein and Neuroprotective Agents/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacology and Optic Nerve/immunology/pathology/physiopathology and Optic Neuritis/drug therapy/immunology/physiopathology and Rats and Rats, Inbred BN and Retinal Ganglion Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology and Severity of Illness Index",eng,0969-9961 (Print) 0969-9961,514-25,25,17239606,"Neurologische UniversitÃ¤tsklinik, Robert-Koch-Strasse 40, D-37075 GÃ¶ttingen, Germany. kmaier@gwdg.de",NA,NA,NA,NA,Mar,NLM,1350,"ASReview_relevant and Maier, Katharina and Merkler, Doron and Gerber, Joachim and Taheri, Naimeh and Kuhnert, Antje V and Williams, Sarah K and Neusch, Clemens and B<c3><a4>hr, Mathias and Diem, Ricarda and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2007/01/24 and Neurobiol Dis. 2007 Mar;25(3):514-25. doi: 10.1016/j.nbd.2006.10.022.

Phycocyanobilin (PCB), a chromophore of the biliprotein C-Phycocyanin (C-PC) from Spirulina platensis, has antioxidant, immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in this disease, and it could complement the effect of other Disease Modifying Treatments (DMT), such as Interferon-<ce><b2> (IFN-<ce><b2>). Here, our main goal was to evaluate the potential PCB benefits and its mechanisms of action to counteract the chronic EAE in mice. MOG(35-55)-induced EAE was implemented in C57BL/6 female mice. Clinical signs, pro-inflammatory cytokines levels by ELISA, qPCR in the brain and immunohistochemistry using precursor/mature oligodendrocytes cells antibodies in the spinal cord, were assessed. PCB enhanced the neurological condition, and waned the brain concentrations of IL-17A and IL-6, pro-inflammatory cytokines, in a dose-dependent manner. A down- or up-regulating activity of PCB at 1 mg/kg was identified in the brain on three (LINGO1, NOTCH1, and TNF-<ce><b1>), and five genes (MAL, CXCL12, MOG, OLIG1, and NKX2-2), respectively. Interestingly, a reduction of demyelination, active microglia/macrophages density, and axonal damage was detected along with an increase in oligodendrocyte precursor cells and mature oligodendrocytes, when assessed the spinal cords of EAE mice that took up PCB. The studies in vitro in rodent encephalitogenic T cells and in vivo in the EAE mouse model with the PCB/IFN-<ce><b2> combination, showed an enhanced positive effect of this combined therapy. Overall, these results demonstrate the anti-inflammatory activity and the protective properties of PCB on the myelin and support its use with IFN-<ce><b2> as an improved DMT combination for MS.",10.3389/fimmu.2022.1036200,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.1036200,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,9,Interferon Beta 1,control,1,70.5,"1,2",2,9.5,0.2,2.4,9.5,0.4,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Mar.U.00C3..U.00AD.n.Prida_2022_FronImmu,JOUR,NA,"Female and Animals and Mice and *Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental and Phycocyanin/adverse effects and *Multiple Sclerosis/drug therapy and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Anti-Inflammatory Agents/adverse effects and Disease Models, Animal and Cytokines/therapeutic use and Interferon-beta/therapeutic use and antioxidants and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and interferon-<ce><b2> and multiple sclerosis and phycocyanobilin and proinflammatory cytokines and remyelination",eng,1664-3224,1036200,13,36405721,"Center for Research and Biological Evaluations, Institute of Pharmacy and Food, University of Havana, Havana, Cuba.

METHODS: The current study investigated the effect of antigen B of hydatid cyst fluid on the reduction of anti-inflammatory cytokines and nerve conduction velocity in rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-induced MS. After isolation of antigen B from sterile cyst fluid, the rats were randomly divided into four groups: saline, EAE, EAE + teriflunomide (EAE + TF), and EAE + antigen B (EAE + AngB). The EAE model was induced using cow spinal cord homogenization, in combination with Freund's complete adjuvant. The serum concentration of cytokines including IL-1B and IL-17, IL-10, IL-6, and TNF-X was measured by the ELISA method, and real-time PCR was performed to study gene expression. Electrophysiological, behavioral, and neuropathological tests were also conducted. RESULTS: Nerve conduction velocity and IL-10 concentration were increased in the antigen B group. The results of this study showed that antigen B reduced the inflammatory component of the EAE MS animal model by modulating the immune system compared to teriflunomide, which eventually led to a reduction in symptoms at the behavioral and electrophysiological level. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that antigen B plays a critical role in regulating immunity and it can be used as a possible therapeutic agent to modulate the immune system in MS patients. It might be rational to consider hydatid cyst fluid antigen as a modifier in MS.",10.1002/brb3.2874,https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2874,WZ,1,NA,EAE,rat,Wistar,male,6,Teriflunomide,control,1,32,1,0.5,8,0.4,6.7,8,0.3,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Mariki_2023_BraiBeha,JOUR,2,"Female and Cattle and Rats and Animals and Mice and *Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology and Cytokines/metabolism and *Multiple Sclerosis/drug therapy/pathology and Interleukin-10/metabolism and Spinal Cord and Interleukin-6 and Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Eae and cytokines and multiple sclerosis and Antigen B",eng,NA,e2874,13,36582052,"Student Research Committee, Jiroft University of Medical Sciences, Jiroft, Iran.

Since GA may influence the response of non-neuronal cells in the spinal cord, it is possible that, to some extent, this drug affects the synaptic changes induced during the exacerbation of EAE. In the present study, we investigated whether GA has a positive influence on the loss of inputs to the motoneurons during the course of EAE in rats. Lewis rats were subjected to EAE associated with GA or placebo treatment. The animals were sacrificed after 15 days of treatment and the spinal cords processed for immunohistochemical analysis and transmission electron microscopy. A correlation between the synaptic changes and glial activation was obtained by performing labeling of synaptophysin and glial fibrillary acidic protein using immunohistochemical analysis. Ultrastructural analysis of the terminals apposed to alpha motoneurons was also performed by electron transmission microscopy. Interestingly, although the GA treatment preserved synaptophysin labeling, it did not significantly reduce the glial reaction, indicating that inflammatory activity was still present. Also, ultrastructural analysis showed that GA treatment significantly prevented retraction of both F and S type terminals compared to placebo.

We have studied the effects of a novel PDE7 inhibitor (PDE7i) treatment on mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) a model of multiple sclerosis (MS) and compared it with another PDE7i. EAE was induced by immunizing C57BL/6J mice with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG(35-55)) peptide. Mice were treated daily either from disease onset or from disease peak with each PDE7i and with fingolimod (used in therapy for MS patients) and disease evolution was followed by clinical symptoms.

Treatment of EAE mice with the novel PDE7i, VP3.15 showed more efficacy in reducing clinical signs at 10mgkg(-1) than the other PDE7i, BRL50481 and similar to fingolimod.

We have analyzed some critical features of the T cell activation process in lymph nodes after IFNbeta treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in SJL mice. Prevention of clinical signs and drastic reduction of perivascular infiltrates in the central nervous system (CNS) were accompanied by alterations in nuclear DNA binding activity levels of NFkappaB and Stat6 transcription factors in lymph node cells (LNC). A decrease of active NFkappaB subunits in treated animals correlated with lower levels of the cytoplasmic phosphorylated form of IkappaBalpha. Results also showed that nuclear DNA binding activity of Stat6 was increased by IFNbeta treatment, as were the cytoplasmic levels of phosphorilated Stat6 (P-Stat6). These high levels of P-Stat6 in IFNbeta-treated animals were accompanied by an increase of IL-4 expression levels measured by real time PCR. In vitro experiments with the IL-4 producing clone D10.G4.1 indicates that the IFNbeta-mediated IL-4 induction is not an effect exclusive to MBP-reactive cells, and suggest that it could be mediated by mRNA stability enlargement. On the other hand, IFNbeta treatment of EAE produced no significant changes in peripheral IFNgamma expression and a striking decrease of IL-17. These findings suggest that the inhibition of NFkappaB activity, the increase of IL-4 expression and its signaling transduction, and the decrease of IL-17 may cooperate to some of the antiinflammatory effects of IFNbeta on EAE.",10.1016/j.molimm.2007.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2007.03.002,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SJL,female,10,Interferon Beta 1,control,NA,NA,1,0.5,5,0.2,3.2,5,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Mart.U.00C3..U.00AD.n.Saavedra_2007_MolImm,JOUR,14,"Animals and Cattle and Cells, Cultured and Central Nervous System/pathology and DNA/metabolism and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/*pathology and Female and Gene Expression Regulation and Inflammation Mediators/*immunology and Interferon-beta/*therapeutic use and Interleukin-17/genetics/metabolism and Interleukin-4/genetics/metabolism and Lymph Nodes/cytology and Mice and Myelin Basic Protein and NF-kappa B/metabolism and Protein Binding and RNA Stability and RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism and STAT6 Transcription Factor/metabolism and T-Lymphocytes/*immunology",eng,0161-5890 (Print) 0161-5890,3597-607,44,17420051,"Unidad de RegulaciÃ³n GÃ©nica, Centro Nacional de MicrobiologÃ­a, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Carretera Majadahonda-Pozuelo Km 2, Madrid, Spain.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Jul,NLM,1336,"ASReview_relevant and Mart<c3><ad>n-Saavedra, Francisco M and Flores, Natalia and Dorado, Beatriz and Eguiluz, C<c3><a9>sar and Bravo, Beatriz and Garc<c3><ad>a-Merino, Antonio and Ballester, Sara and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and England and 2007/04/11 and Mol Immunol. 2007 Jul;44(14):3597-607. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2007.03.002.

However, the accurate mechanisms to explain its anti-inflammatory activity in the disease are not fully revealed. Available data support that T lymphocytes are among the main cell targets of IFN-beta. We have found that in vitro anti-CD3 stimulation of uncommitted murine na<c3><af>ve T cells under IFN-beta treatment results in skewing the T cell differentiation process towards the T2 phenotype, in a prevention from apoptosis of naturally occurring CD4+ T regulatory cells (nTreg) in correlation with an increase in Bcl-XL expression, and in a decrease of IL-17 expression. Elimination of nTreg from the primary culture of na<c3><af>ve CD4+ cells abolished the down-regulation of IL-17 driven by IFN-beta, what suggests the interaction between Th17 and nTreg subsets.

METHODS: The effect of TF on oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation and differentiation was assessed in vitro in glial cultures derived from neonatal mice and confirmed on fluorescence-activated cell sorting-sorted adult OPCs. The levels of the 8,9-unsaturated sterols lanosterol and zymosterol were quantified in TF- and sham-treated cultures. In vivo, TF was administered orally, and remyelination was assessed both in myelin basic protein-GFP-nitroreductase (Mbp:GFP-NTR) transgenic Xenopus laevis demyelinated by metronidazole and in adult mice demyelinated by lysolecithin. RESULTS: In cultures, low concentrations of TF down to 10 nM decreased OPC proliferation and increased their differentiation, an effect that was also detected on adult OPCs. Oligodendrocyte differentiation induced by TF was abrogated by the oxidosqualene cyclase inhibitor Ro 48-8071 and was mediated by the accumulation of zymosterol. In the demyelinated tadpole, TF enhanced the regeneration of mature oligodendrocytes up to 2.5-fold. In the mouse demyelinated spinal cord, TF promoted the differentiation of newly generated oligodendrocytes by a factor of 1.7-fold and significantly increased remyelination. DISCUSSION: TF enhances zymosterol accumulation in oligodendrocytes and CNS myelin repair, a beneficial off-target effect that should be investigated in patients with multiple sclerosis.",10.1212/nxi.0000000000001091,https://doi.org/10.1212/nxi.0000000000001091,WZ,1,NA,lysolecithin,"mouse, xenopus",C57BL/6,NA,NA,Teriflunomide,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Martin_2021_NeurNeurNeur,JOUR,6,"Animals and Animals, Newborn and Cells, Cultured and Central Nervous System Diseases/*drug therapy/metabolism and Cholesterol/*metabolism and Crotonates/administration & dosage/*pharmacology and Demyelinating Diseases/*drug therapy and Disease Models, Animal and Hydroxybutyrates/administration & dosage/*pharmacology and Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology and Larva and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Transgenic and Nitriles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology and Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells/*drug effects/metabolism and Oligodendroglia/*drug effects/metabolism and Remyelination/*drug effects and Toluidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology and Xenopus laevis",eng,2332-7812,NA,8,34642237,"From the Sorbonne UniversitÃ©, Paris Brain Institute, CNRS, Inserm (E.M., M.-S.A., C.B., C.L., B.N.O., B.Z., B.S.); PitiÃ©-SalpÃªtriÃ¨re Hospital, APHP (F.L., C.L.); and Saint Antoine Hospital, APHP (B.S.), Paris, France.

Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein is a minor component of the myelin sheath, but is an important autoantigen linked to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). CNPase is expressed exclusively by oligodendrocytes in the CNS, and the appearance of CNPase seems to be one of the earliest events of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. In this study the effects of vitamin D on total protein concentration, CNPase and MOG expression in the cerebral cortex of the murine model of cuprizone-induced demyelination was investigated. The mice were treated by cuprizone for five weeks in order to induce demyelination. The mice were then divided into 3 groups. The first group was injected intraperitoneally (IP) with vitamin D diluted in olive oil in the amount of 5 <c2><b5>g/kg/daily body weight. The second group (SHAM) was injected IP with olive oil and the third group was left without any injection as the control group (n = 11 for each group). After five weeks the mice were killed and the cerebral cortex was collected and the expression of CNPase and MOG was studied by Western blot. Total protein concentration in the vitamin D injected, SHAM and control groups were 0.918 <c2><b1> 0.003, 0917 <c2><b1> 0.004 and 0.916 <c2><b1> 0.004 g/l, respectively (p > 0.05).

Here, we show that 1,25(OH)2D3 and a non-hypercalcemic analogue are selective and potent inhibitors of Th1 development in vitro and in vivo without inducing a deviation to the Th2 phenotype. Administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 or its analogue prevents chronic-relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (CR-EAE) induced by the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide 35-55 (MOG35-55) in Biozzi AB/H mice. The inhibition of EAE induction is associated with a profound reduction of MOG35-55-specific proliferation and Th1 cell development. Importantly, the non-hypercalcemic analogue also provides long-term protection from EAE relapses induced by immunization with spinal cord homogenate when administered for a short time at symptom onset or even after the first peak of disease. Neuropathological analysis shows a reduction of inflammatory infiltrates, demyelinated areas and axonal loss in brains and spinal cords of treated mice.

Environmental factors may be key to MS prevention and treatment. MS prevalence and severity decrease with increasing sunlight exposure and vitamin D(3) supplies, supporting our hypothesis that the sunlight-dependent hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-(OH)(2) D(3) ), inhibits autoimmune T-cell responses in MS. Moreover, 1,25-(OH)(2) D(3) inhibits and reverses experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an MS model. Here, we investigated whether 1,25-(OH)(2) D(3) inhibits EAE via the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in T lymphocytes. Using bone marrow chimeric mice with a disrupted VDR only in radio-sensitive hematopoietic cells or radio-resistant non-hematopoietic cells, we found that hematopoietic cell VDR function was necessary for 1,25-(OH)(2) D(3) to inhibit EAE. Furthermore, conditional targeting experiments showed that VDR function in T cells was necessary. Neither 1,25-(OH)(2) D(3) nor T-cell-specific VDR targeting influenced CD4(+) Foxp3(+) T-cell proportions in the periphery or the CNS in these studies.

Because CD8+ T cells have been implicated as both suppressors and effectors of the inflammation associated with multiple sclerosis and EAE, we examined the question of whether the 1,25-(OH)2D3 suppression of EAE occurs through a CD8+ T cell-dependent mechanism.

It is currently being developed for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). We report here for the first time the anti-inflammatory effects of teriflunomide in the Dark Agouti rat model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Neurological evaluation demonstrated that prophylactic dosing of teriflunomide at 3 and 10 mg/kg delayed disease onset and reduced maximal and cumulative scores. Therapeutic administration of teriflunomide at doses of 3 or 10 mg/kg at disease onset significantly reduced maximal and cumulative disease scores as compared to vehicle treated rats. Dosing teriflunomide at disease remission, at 3 and 10 mg/kg, reduced the cumulative scores for the remaining course of the disease. Teriflunomide at 10 mg/kg significantly reduced inflammation, demyelination, and axonal loss when dosed prophylactically or therapeutically. In electrophysiological somatosensory evoked potential studies, therapeutic administration of teriflunomide, at the onset of disease, prevented both a decrease in waveform amplitude and an increase in the latency to waveform initiation in EAE animals compared to vehicle.

Current treatments therefore target anti-inflammatory mechanisms to impede or slow disease progression. The identification of a means to enhance axon myelination would present new therapeutic approaches to inhibit and possibly reverse disease progression. Previously, LRR and Ig domain-containing, Nogo receptor-interacting protein (LINGO-1) has been identified as an in vitro and in vivo negative regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Here we show that loss of LINGO-1 function by Lingo1 gene knockout or by treatment with an antibody antagonist of LINGO-1 function leads to functional recovery from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. This is reflected biologically by improved axonal integrity, as confirmed by magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, and by newly formed myelin sheaths, as determined by electron microscopy. Antagonism of LINGO-1 or its pathway is therefore a promising approach for the treatment of demyelinating diseases of the CNS.",10.1038/nm1664,https://doi.org/10.1038/nm1664,WZ,1,NA,EAE,"mouse, rat","C57BL/6, Sprague-Dawley",NA,9.5,Opicinumab,control,1,NA,"1,2",0.6,9,0.2,2.2,8,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Clinical scores are from Fig 2B, rats",Mi_2007_NatMed,JOUR,10,"Animals and Axons/diagnostic imaging/*physiology/ultrastructure and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*chemically induced/pathology and Injections, Spinal and Membrane Proteins/administration & dosage/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology and Mice and Mice, Knockout and Myelin Proteins and Myelin Sheath/*physiology/ultrastructure and Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein/immunology/pharmacology and Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein and Nerve Tissue Proteins/administration & dosage/*antagonists & and inhibitors/physiology and Rats and Spinal Cord Injuries/pathology/physiopathology/*therapy and Tomography, X-Ray Computed",eng,1078-8956 (Print) 1078-8956,1228-33,13,17906634,"Biogen Idec Inc., 14 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142, USA. sha.mi@biogenidec.com",NA,NA,NA,NA,Oct,NLM,1306,"ASReview_relevant and Mi, Sha and Hu, Bing and Hahm, Kyungmin and Luo, Yi and Kam Hui, Edward Sai and Yuan, Qiuju and Wong, Wai Man and Wang, Li and Su, Huanxing and Chu, Tak-Ho and Guo, Jiasong and Zhang, Wenming and So, Kwok-Fai and Pepinsky, Blake and Shao, Zhaohui and Graff, Christilyn and Garber, Ellen and Jung, Vincent and Wu, Ed Xuekui and Wu, Wutian and Journal Article and United States and 2007/10/02 and Nat Med. 2007 Oct;13(10):1228-33. doi: 10.1038/nm1664.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the prophylactic potential of this association in EAE. C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated with MOG in the presence of VitD and then subjected to EAE induction. Animals were euthanized 7 and 19days after disease induction and the following parameters were evaluated: body weight, clinical score, inflammatory process in the CNS, amount of dendritic cells (DCs) and regulatory T cells in the spleen and cytokine production by spleen and CNS cell cultures. Vaccination with MOG associated with VitD determined a drastic reduction in clinical score, body weight loss, CNS inflammation, DCs maturation and also in the production of cytokines by CNS and spleen cell cultures.

Vitamin D3 (VitD) is endowed with immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties that we demonstrated to control EAE development. However, this protective effect triggered hypercalcemia. As such, we compared the therapeutic potential of VitD and paricalcitol (Pari), which is a non-hypercalcemic vitamin D analog, to control EAE. From the seventh day on after EAE induction, mice were injected with VitD or Pari every other day. VitD, but not Pari, displayed downmodulatory ability being able to reduce the recruitment of inflammatory cells, the mRNA expression of inflammatory parameters, and demyelination at the CNS. Lower production of proinflammatory cytokines by lymph node-derived cells and IL-17 by gut explants, and reduced intestinal inflammation were detected in the EAE/VitD group compared to the EAE untreated or Pari groups.

However, it is unknown whether natalizumab is beneficial for progressive forms of MS. Therefore, we assessed the effects of anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy in a progressive experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model. Notably, we found that early therapy could significantly reduce the severity of progressive EAE, while treatment initiated at an advanced stage was less efficient. Furthermore, we observed the accumulation of a novel subset of GM-CSF-producing CD11b+CD4+ T cells in the CNS throughout disease progression. Importantly, early therapeutic anti-VLA-4 mAb treatment suppressed the accumulation of these GM-CSF-producing CD11b+CD4+ T cells in the CNS along with activated microglia/macrophages populations, and also conferred a protective effect against inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration, including demyelination and axonal loss. Collectively, our data suggest that early treatment with anti-VLA-4 mAb can provide neuroprotection against progressive CNS autoimmune disease by preventing the accumulation of pathogenic GM-CSF-producing CD11b+CD4+ T cells in the CNS.",10.1371/journal.pone.0099068,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0099068,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,NA,7,Natalizumab,control,1,NA,"1,2",1.4,13,0.2,3.4,13,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Mindur_2014_PLoOne,JOUR,6,"Animals and Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use and CD11b Antigen/*metabolism and CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology and Central Nervous System/*immunology/pathology and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/immunology/pathology/*prevention & and control and Flow Cytometry and Immunoenzyme Techniques and Integrin alpha4beta1/*immunology/metabolism and Macrophages/cytology/immunology/metabolism and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL",eng,1932-6203,e99068,9,24896098,"Department of Neurology, Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States of America.",NA,NA,Competing Interests: Dr. Ito received a research grant from Biogen/Idec.

Alpha-tocopherol (AT) has been found to improve motor function in an animal model of MS. In the present study, the effects of AT and fingolimod on the locomotor function and histological evidence of demyelination were compared in a cuprizone-induced rat model of MS. Experimental approach: Female Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks) were fed with 0.2% (w/w) cuprizone diet for 5 weeks followed by intraperitoneal injections of fingolimod (3 mg/Kg; group F, n = 10) and alpha- tocopherol (100 mg/Kg; group A, n = 10). Vehicle-treated rats (group V, n = 10) were treated intraperitoneally with 1% ethanol in saline on weeks 6 and 7. Open field and beam walking tests were carried out every 10 days. The mean area of demyelination in the corpus callosum was quantified using Luxol fast blue stained histological sections of the forebrain. Findings/Results: The mean speed of movement was increased by 54% and 50% in groups F and A compared to group V. Total distance moved was increased by 61% and 52.7% in groups F and A compared to group V. Mean time to walk the beam was reduced in group A by 52% compared to group V. Mean frequency of crossing lines from the inner squares to outer squares was reduced in groups A and F compared to group V. Mean area of demyelination in corpus callosum showed 62% reduction in group A compared to group V. Conclusion and implications: Both fingolimod and AT treatments improved the locomotor function.

Fourteen genes were selectively influenced by Atorvastatin in EAE mice. They are mainly related to immune cell functions and regulation of cell-to-cell interaction. Interestingly, seven genes were also differentially regulated in CFA-injected control mice. But qualitative and quantitative differences to EAE mice argue for a dependency of statin effects on the activation status of target cells. Differential regulation of the newly detected candidate genes of statin effects COX-1 and HSP-105 and the previously known statin-responsive genes ICAM-1 and CD86 was confirmed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Flow cytometric analysis of lymph node cells revealed that the effect of Atorvastatin treatment in non-immunized healthy animals resembled the effect of immunization with PLP peptide regarding changes of T helper cells, activated B cells and macrophages. In EAE mice, these effects were partially reversed by Atorvastatin treatment. Monitoring of expression of the newly identified candidate genes and patterns of lymphocyte subpopulations might predict the responsiveness of multiple sclerosis patients to statin treatment. <c2><a9> 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, glutamatergic dysregulation in the cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus (CxBGTh) circuit could be associated with decline in these behaviors. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of an immunomodulatory therapy (teriflunomide, Aubagio<c2><ae>) on changes of the CxBGTh loop in the Theiler's Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus, (TMEV) mouse model of MS. METHODS: Forty-eight (48) mice were infected with TMEV, treated with teriflunomide (24) or control vehicle (24) and followed for 39 weeks. Mice were examined with MRS and volumetric MRI scans (0, 8, 26, and 39 weeks) in the cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus, using a 9.4T scanner, and with behavioral tests (0, 4, 8, 12, 17, 26, and 39 weeks). Within conditions, MRI measures were compared between two time points by paired samples t-test and across multiple time points by repeated measures ANOVA (rmANOVA), and between conditions by independent samples t-test and rmANOVA, respectively. Data were considered as significant at the p<0.01 level and as a trend at p<0.05 level. RESULTS: In the thalamus, the teriflunomide arm exhibited trends toward decreased glutamate levels at 8 and 26 weeks compared to the control arm (p = 0.039 and p = 0.026), while the control arm exhibited a trend toward increased glutamate between 0 to 8 weeks (p = 0.045). In the basal ganglia, the teriflunomide arm exhibited a trend toward decreased glutamate earlier than the control arm, from 0 to 8 weeks (p = 0.011), resulting in decreased glutamate compared to the control arm at 8 weeks (p = 0.016).

Here, we identified a pathway for immune cells to traffic from the brain that is associated with the rostral migratory stream (RMS), which is a forebrain source of newly generated neurons. Evaluation of fluorescently labeled leukocyte migration in mice revealed that DCs travel via the RMS from the CNS to the cervical LNs (CxLNs), where they present antigen to T cells. Pharmacologic interruption of immune cell traffic with the mononuclear cell-sequestering drug fingolimod influenced anti-CNS T cell responses in the CxLNs and modulated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) severity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Fingolimod treatment also induced EAE in a disease-resistant transgenic mouse strain by altering DC-mediated Treg functions in CxLNs and disrupting CNS immune tolerance. These data describe an immune cell pathway that originates in the CNS and is capable of dampening anti-CNS immune responses in the periphery. Furthermore, these data provide insight into how fingolimod treatment might exacerbate CNS neuroinflammation in some cases and suggest that focal therapeutic interventions, outside the CNS have the potential to selectively modify anti-CNS immunity.",10.1172/jci71544,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci71544,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,9,Fingolimod,control,2,NA,0,2.4,3,0.7,4,3,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Mohammad_2014_JCI,JOUR,3,"Animals and CD11 Antigens/metabolism and *Cell Movement and Cells, Cultured and Dendritic Cells/*physiology and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/chemically and induced/immunology/pathology and Female and Fingolimod Hydrochloride and *Immune Tolerance and Lymph Nodes/immunology/pathology and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Transgenic and Neck and Propylene Glycols and Prosencephalon/*immunology/pathology and Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives and T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology",eng,0021-9738 (Print) 0021-9738,1228-41,124,24569378,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMC3934177,Mar,NLM,841,"ASReview_relevant and 1558-8238 and Mohammad, Mohammad G and Tsai, Vicky W W and Ruitenberg, Marc J and Hassanpour, Masoud and Li, Hui and Hart, Prue H and Breit, Samuel N and Sawchenko, Paul E and Brown, David A and R01 NS021182/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and R37 NS021182/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and NS-21182/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2014/02/27 and J Clin Invest. 2014 Mar;124(3):1228-41. doi: 10.1172/JCI71544.

Objective: To evaluate the effects of vitamin D on the expression of IL-27 and IL-33 in a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Methods: EAE was induced in C57BL/6 mice by immunization with myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant. The mice were administered with PBS or olive oil, intraperitoneally, in the control groups and vitamin D (200 ng every two days) in the treatment group, from day +3 to +30. At day 31, the mice were scarified and their spinal cords and brains were harvested. The expression of the IL-27 and IL-33 mRNA in the spinal cord was measured using real time-PCR. Results: In PBS- or olive oil-treated EAE mice the expression of IL-27 P28 mRNA was significantly lower than that in the healthy control group (p<0.002). In both PBS- and olive oil-treated EAE groups, the expression of IL-27 EBI3 mRNA was also lower than that observed in the healthy group, but the differences were not significant. In vitamin D-treated EAE group, the expression of IL-27 P28 and IL-27 EBI3 were significantly higher compared with the olive oil-treated EAE groups (p<0.002 and p<0.04, respectively). The expression of IL-33 was significantly higher in PBS-or olive oil-treated EAE groups compared with healthy mice (p<0.05 and p<0.02, respectively). Vitamin D significantly decreased the expression of IL-33 compared with PBSor olive oil-treated EAE mice (p<0.04, p<0.02, respectively). The PBS- or e oiloliv-treated EAE mice showed the clinical symptoms of EAE at days 9 and 10, respectively. The vitamin D-treated EAE group exhibited the symptoms at day 12 post immunization. The maximum mean clinical score and mean pathological scores were also significantly lower in vitamin Dtreated EAE group, in comparison with PBS- or olive oil treated EAE mice (p<0.001).

One of the suggested modes of action is the potential of FAE to exert a neuroprotective effect. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have investigated the impact of monomethylfumarate (MMF) and dimethylfumaric acid (DMF) on de- and remyelination using the toxic cuprizone model where the blood-brain-barrier remains intact and only scattered T-cells and peripheral macrophages are found in the central nervous system (CNS), thus excluding the influence of immunomodulatory effects on peripheral immune cells. FAE showed marginally accelerated remyelination in the corpus callosum compared to controls. However, we found no differences for demyelination and glial reactions in vivo and no cytoprotective effect on oligodendroglial cells in vitro. In contrast, DMF had a significant inhibitory effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced nitric oxide burst in microglia and induced apoptosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). CONCLUSIONS: These results contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of action of fumaric acids. Our data suggest that fumarates have no or only little direct protective effects on oligodendrocytes in this toxic model and may act rather indirectly via the modulation of immune cells.",10.1371/journal.pone.0011769,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011769,WZ,1,NA,cuprizone,mouse,C57BL/6,male,8,Dimethyl fumarate,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Moharregh.Khiabani_2010_PLoOne,JOUR,7,"Animals and Apoptosis/drug effects and Cells, Cultured and Central Nervous System/*drug effects/*metabolism and Cuprizone/*toxicity and Demyelinating Diseases/*drug therapy and Dimethyl Fumarate and Fumarates/*therapeutic use and Immunohistochemistry and Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects and Male and Maleates/therapeutic use and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Rats and Rats, Sprague-Dawley",eng,1932-6203,e11769,5,20668697,"Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.",NA,NA,"Competing Interests: This study was partially supported by Biogen Idec.

We investigated the innate immune signaling pathways that participate in GA-mediated M2 monocyte polarization. METHODS: Monocytes were isolated from myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)-deficient, Toll-IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon (IFN)-<ce><b2> (TRIF)-deficient, IFN-<ce><b1>/<ce><b2> receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1)-deficient, and wild-type (WT) mice and human peripheral blood. GA-treated monocytes were stimulated with Toll-like receptor ligands, then evaluated for activation of kinases and transcription factors involved in innate immunity, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. GA-treated mice were evaluated for cytokine secretion and susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. RESULTS: GA-mediated inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes occurred independently of MyD88 and nuclear factor-<ce><ba>B, but was blocked by TRIF deficiency. Furthermore, GA did not provide clinical benefit in TRIF-deficient mice. GA inhibited activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, an upstream regulator of activating transcription factor (ATF)-2, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1, which regulates IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Consequently, nuclear translocation of ATF-2 and IRF3, components of the IFN-<ce><b2> enhanceosome, was impaired. Consistent with these observations, GA inhibited production of IFN-<ce><b2> in vivo in WT mice, but did not modulate proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes from IFNAR1-deficient mice. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that GA inhibits the type I IFN pathway in M2 polarization of monocytes independently of MyD88, providing an important mechanism connecting innate and adaptive immune modulation in GA therapy and valuable insight regarding its potential use with other MS treatments.",10.1212/nxi.0000000000000179,https://doi.org/10.1212/nxi.0000000000000179,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,9,Glatiramer acetate,control,NA,NA,1,1.8,NA,0.2,3.1,NA,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Molnarfi_2015_NeurNeurNeur,JOUR,6,NA,eng,2332-7812 (Print) 2332-7812,e179,2,26601118,"Department of Neurology and Program in Immunology (N.M., T.P., U.S.-T., C.M.S., J.C.P., S.S.Z.), University of California, San Francisco; the Institute of Neuropathology and Department of Neurology (M.S.W.), University Medical Center, Georg-August University, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany; the Department of Pathology and Immunology (P.H.L.), Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva; and the Department of Neurosciences (P.H.L.), Division of Neurology, University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland.

The underlying multifactorial anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective effect of GA is in the induction of reactive T cells that release immunomodulatory cytokines and neurotrophic factors at the injury site. These GA-induced cytokines and growth factors may have a direct effect on axon function. Building on previous findings that suggest a neuroprotective effect of GA, we assessed the therapeutic effects of GA on brain and spinal cord pathology and functional correlates using the chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. Therapeutic regimens were utilized based on promising prophylactic efficacy. More specifically, C57BL/6 mice were treated with 2 mg/mouse/day GA for 8 days beginning at various time points after EAE post-induction day 15, yielding a thorough, clinically relevant assessment of GA efficacy within the context of severe progressive disease. Therapeutic treatment with GA significantly decreased clinical scores and improved rotorod motor performance in EAE mice. These functional improvements were supported by an increase in myelinated axons and fewer amyloid precursor protein-positive axons in the spinal cords of GA-treated EAE mice. Furthermore, therapeutic GA decreased microglia/macrophage and T cell infiltrates and increased oligodendrocyte numbers in both the spinal cord and corpus callosum of EAE mice. Finally, GA improved callosal axon conduction and nodal protein organization in EAE. Our results demonstrate that therapeutic GA treatment has significant beneficial effects in a chronic mouse model of MS, in which its positive effects on both myelinated and non-myelinated axons results in improved axon function.",10.1002/jnr.23440,https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.23440,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,both,8,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,NA,2,2,20,0.3,3.6,20,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,M und F poolen,Moore_2014_JNR,JOUR,12,"Action Potentials/drug effects/genetics and Animals and Axons/drug effects/*metabolism and Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism and Brain/pathology and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/chemically induced/*complications and Glatiramer Acetate and Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and In Vitro Techniques and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Transgenic and Movement Disorders/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology and Myelin Basic Protein/metabolism and Myelin Proteolipid Protein/genetics/metabolism and Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism and Neural Conduction/*drug effects and Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2 and Oligodendroglia/pathology and Peptides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Severity of Illness Index and Spinal Cord/pathology and Time Factors and axon conduction and demyelination and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and inflammation and motor deficit and multiple sclerosis (MS) and neural repair and neurodegeneration and rotarod and therapeutics",eng,0360-4012 (Print) 0360-4012,1621-36,92,24989965,"Department of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California.",NA,NA,NA,PMC4305217,Dec,NLM,803,"ASReview_relevant and 1097-4547 and Moore, Spencer and Khalaj, Anna J and Patel, Rhusheet and Yoon, JaeHee and Ichwan, Daniel and Hayardeny, Liat and Tiwari-Woodruff, Seema K and R01 NS081141/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and United States and 2014/07/06 and J Neurosci Res. 2014 Dec;92(12):1621-36. doi: 10.1002/jnr.23440.

The most important unmet need in MS is use of treatments that delay the progression of the disease. Leucine-rich repeat and Immunoglobulin-like domain containing NOGO receptor-interacting protein 1(LINGO-1) have been known as inhibitors of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated LINGO-1 antibody effects on remyelination and neurobehavioral deficit using cuprizone-induced demyelination. Animals were randomly divided into three groups (n = 10): (1) Control group; received the regular diet, (2) CPZ group; normal saline was injected intraperitoneally, and (3) Treatment group; LINGO-1 antibody (10 mg/kg) was injected IP once every six days for 3 weeks. We assessed the level of myelin basic protein (MBP), neurofilament heavy chain (NF200), and Brain-derived neuroprotective factor (BDNF) in the corpus callosum (CC) by immunostaining against MBP, NF200, and BDNF. RESULTS: We found decreased levels of MBP, NF200, and BDNF in demyelinated CC, and anti-LINGO-1 treatment improved demyelinated structures. Furthermore, motor impairment was measured by Open-field (OFT) and Balance beam tests. In the treatment group, motor impairment was significantly improved.

Treatments with estrogens have been shown to decrease the severity of EAE through anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Here we investigated whether treatment with an estrogen receptor <ce><b1> (ER<ce><b1>) ligand could recapitulate the estrogen-mediated protection in clinical EAE. We then went on to examine both anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective mechanisms. EAE was induced in wild-type, ER<ce><b1>-, or ER<ce><b2>-deficient mice, and each was treated with the highly selective ER<ce><b1> agonist, propyl pyrazole triol, to determine the effect on clinical outcomes, as well as on inflammatory and neurodegenerative changes. ER<ce><b1> ligand treatment ameliorated clinical disease in both wild-type and ER<ce><b1> knock-out mice, but not in ER<ce><b1> knock-out mice, thereby demonstrating that the ER<ce><b1> ligand maintained ER<ce><b1> selectivity in vivo during disease. ER<ce><b1> ligand treatment also induced favorable changes in autoantigen-specific cytokine production in the peripheral immune system [decreased TNF<ce><b1>, interferon-<ce><b3>, and interleukin-6, with increased interleukin-5] and decreased CNS white matter inflammation and demyelination. Interestingly, decreased neuronal staining [NeuN+ (neuronal-specific nuclear protein)/<ce><b2>3-tubulin+/Nissl], accompanied by increased immunolabeling of microglial/monocyte (Mac 3+) cells surrounding these abnormal neurons, was observed in gray matter of spinal cords of EAE mice at the earliest stage of clinical disease, 1-2 d after the onset of clinical signs. Treatment with either estradiol or the ER<ce><b1> ligand significantly reduced this gray matter pathology. In conclusion, treatment with an ER<ce><b1> ligand is highly selective in vivo, mediating both anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in EAE.

The metabolic processes of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis are further possible downstream targets. In healthy adult mice, high levels of dihydroorotate-dehydrogenase (DHODH) activity are measured in the central nervous system (CNS), and DHODH inhibition may cause indirect effects on reactive oxygen species production and NADPH oxidase (NOX) mediated oxidative stress, known to be key aspects of the inflammatory response of the CNS. However, little is known about the effect of teriflunomide on the dynamics of NOX activation in CNS cells and subsequent alterations of neuronal function in vivo. In this study, we employed fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) and phasor analysis of the endogeneous fluorescence of NAD(P)H (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) in the brain stem of mice to visualize the effect of teriflunomide on cellular metabolism. Furthermore, we simultaneously studied neuronal Ca(2+) signals in transgenic mice with a FRET-based Troponin C Ca(2+) sensor based (CerTN L15) quantified using FRET-FLIM. Hence, we directly correlated neuronal (dys-)function indicated by steadily elevated calcium levels with metabolic activity in neurons and surrounding CNS tissue. Employing our intravital co-registered imaging approach, we could not detect any significant alteration of NOX activation after incubation of the tissue with teriflunomide. Furthermore, we could not detect any changes of the inflammatory induced neuronal dysfunction due to local treatment with teriflunomide. Concerning drug safety, we can confirm that teriflunomide has no metabolic effects on neuronal function in the CNS tissue during neuroinflammation at concentrations expected in orally treated patients. The combined endogenous FLIM and calcium imaging approach developed by us and employed here uniquely meets the need to monitor cellular metabolism as a basic mechanism of tissue functions in vivo.",10.3389/fmolb.2020.00062,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2020.00062,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,NA,NA,Teriflunomide,control,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Mothes_2020_FroMolBio,JOUR,NA,Eae and calcium imaging and neuronal dysfunction and oxidative stress and teriflunomide,eng,2296-889X (Print) 2296-889x,62,7,32426367,"Institute for Neuropathology, CharitÃ© UniversitÃ¤tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.

Currently approved treatments have several shortcomings. Consequently, new and effective treatments with improved safety and convenience profiles are sought after by patients. OBJECTIVE: To explore the overall profile of vidofludimus for the treatment of RRMS. METHODS: Preclinical investigations were done exploring the species-dependency of DHODH inhibition of vidofludimus. In addition, the preclinical efficacy in a rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model and the inhibition of cytokine release from activated PBMC were investigated. Pharmacokinetic data were also obtained in a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose trial of the formulation IMU-838 (vidofludimus calcium). RESULTS: It was shown that vidofludimus is 2.6 times more potent in inhibiting DHO oxidation by human DHODH compared to teriflunomide. Although both compounds increased cell apoptosis, vidofludimus was more efficacious in the inhibition of T-lymphocyte proliferation compared to teriflunomide. The same was also observed for the secretion of IL-17 and IFN-<ce><b3>. Interestingly, the potency or vidofludimus to inhibit rat or mouse DHODH is 7.5 and 64.4 time lower than the for the human DHODH, respectively. The rat EAE study clearly exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of cumulative disease scores by vidofludimus. In the multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial, the serum half-life of about 30<c2><a0>h provides a favorable profile for once daily dosing of IMU-838, with quick dosing to steady state through levels within 5 days and the ability to wash out drug quickly, if required. CONCLUSIONS: The investigations highlighted that the desired selective immunomodulatory properties can be separated from general antiproliferative effects seen and related adverse events in first-generation DHODH inhibitors. Based on data obtained from a series of pre-clinical as well as phase 1 and phase 2 studies, IMU-838 is a promising next-generation candidate for the oral treatment of RRMS. However, this will need to be confirmed in the currently ongoing Phase 2 study in RRMS patients.",10.1016/j.msard.2020.102129,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102129,WZ,1,NA,EAE,rat,Dark Agouti,female,11,Teriflunomide,control,1,40,2,0,8,0,2,8,1.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Muehler_2020_MultScleRelaDiso,JOUR,NA,"Animals and *Biphenyl Compounds/therapeutic use and Calcium and *Dicarboxylic Acids/therapeutic use and Humans and Leukocytes, Mononuclear and Mice and *Multiple Sclerosis and *Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/drug therapy and Rats and Dhodh and Drug profil and Imu<e2><80><93>838 and Multiple Sclerosis and New oral drug and Terifludomide and Vidofludimus",eng,2211-0348,102129,43,32428844,"Immunic AG, Am Klopferspitz 19, 82152 Planegg-Martinsried, Germany.

Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective effects of ozanimod (RPC1063), a S1P1/5 modulator recently approved in the United States for the treatment of MS, by performing ex vivo studies in EAE brain. Electrophysiological experiments, supported by molecular and immunofluorescence analysis, revealed that ozanimod was able to dampen the EAE glutamatergic synaptic alterations, through attenuation of local inflammatory response driven by activated microglia and infiltrating T cells, the main CNS-cellular players of EAE synaptopathy. Electrophysiological studies with selective S1P1 (AUY954) and S1P5 (A971432) agonists suggested that S1P1 modulation is the main driver of the anti-excitotoxic activity mediated by ozanimod. Accordingly, in vivo intra-cerebroventricular treatment of EAE mice with AUY954 ameliorated clinical disability.

Vitamin D deficiency is commonly observed in MS patients and vitamin D supplements reduce the clinical symptoms of EAE and MS. Earlier studies have shown that in vivo treatment with vitamin D analogs ameliorates EAE in association with the inhibition of IL-12 production and Th1 differentiation. The mechanisms in the regulation of Th1 response by vitamin D in EAE/MS are, however, not known. We show that in vivo treatment of C57BL/6 and SJL/J mice (i.p.) with 100 ng of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, on every other day from Day 0-30, ameliorates EAE in association with the inhibition of IL-12 production and neural antigen-specific Th1 response. In vitro treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited IFN<ce><b3>-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, without affecting JAK2, in EOC-20 microglial cells. Treatment of activated T cells with 1,25(OH)2D3 also inhibited the IL-12-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, TYK2, STAT3, and STAT4 in association with a decrease in T cell proliferation in vitro. These findings highlight the fact that vitamin D modulates JAK-STAT signaling pathway in IL-12/IFN<ce><b3> axis leading to Th1 differentiation and further suggest its use in the treatment of MS and other Th1 cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. <c2><a9> 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",10.1002/jnr.20826,https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.20826,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,"C57BL/6, SJL",female,5,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,1,0,10,0,2.6,10,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Clinical scores extracted are from C57BL/6 mice because of larger effect size,Muthian_2006_JoofNeRe,JOUR,7,calcitriol and gamma interferon and interleukin 12 and Janus kinase and Janus kinase 2 and STAT protein and STAT1 protein and STAT3 protein and STAT4 protein and vitamin D and vitamin D receptor and autoimmune encephalomyelitis and animal cell and animal experiment and animal model and animal tissue and article and cell differentiation and cell proliferation and cell stimulation and controlled study and cytokine production and drug effect and enzyme inhibition and female and immunomodulation and inflammation and microglia and mouse and multiple sclerosis and neuromodulation and nonhuman and priority journal and protein interaction and protein phosphorylation and signal transduction and spleen cell and T lymphocyte activation and Th1 cell,English,0360-4012 1097-4547,1299-1309,83,NA,"J.J.

However, the side effect of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) and its synthetic secosteroidal analogs is hypercalcemia, which is a major impediment in their clinical development for autoimmune diseases. Hypercalcemia develops as a result of the action of VDR agonists on the intestine. Here, we describe the identification of a VDR modulator (VDRM) compound A that was transcriptionally less active in intestinal cells and as a result exhibited less calcemic activity in vivo than 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3).

This study reports modulation of Smad signaling by the specific binding of the VDR along with its heterodimeric partner RXR to the negative vitamin D response element on the promoter of Smad7, which leads to Smad7 gene repression. The vitamin D receptor-mediated increase in Smad3 expression partially explains the IL10 augmentation seen in Th17 cells. Furthermore, the VDR axis also modulates non-Smad signaling by activating ERK during differentiation of Th17 cells, which inhibits the Th17-specific genes il17a, il17f, il22, and il23r.

Geographic, genetic, and biological evidence suggests that one environmental risk factor may be lack of vitamin D. Here, we investigated how 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)) inhibits experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an MS model. The experiments used adoptive transfer of TCR-transgenic (TCR1) cells specific for myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide into unprimed recipients. When unprimed TCR1 splenocytes were transferred, and the recipients were immunized with peptide, the mock-treated mice developed EAE, but the 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-treated recipients remained disease-free. Both groups had TCR1 T cells that proliferated in response to MBP Ac1-11 and produced IFN-gamma but not IL-4 in the lymph node. In the central nervous system (CNS), the mock-treated mice had activated TCR1 T cells that produced IFN-gamma but not IL-4, while the 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-treated mice had TCR1 T cells with a non-activated phenotype that did not produce IFN-gamma or IL-4. When activated TCR1 T cells producing IFN-gamma were transferred into unprimed mice, the mock-treated and the 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-treated recipients developed EAE. Likewise, the 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) did not inhibit Th1 cell IFN-gamma production or promote Th2 cell genesis or IL-4 production in vitro. Finally, the 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) inhibited EAE in MBP-specific TCR-transgenic mice that were Rag-1(+), but not in animals that were Rag-1-null. Together, these data refute the hypothesis that the hormone inhibits Th1 cell genesis or function directly or through an action on antigen-presenting cells, or promotes Th2 cell genesis or function. Instead, the evidence supports a model wherein the 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) acts through a Rag-1-dependent cell to limit the occurrence of activated, autoreactive T cells in the CNS.",10.1016/s0165-5728(01)00360-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0165-5728(01)00360-5,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,B10.PL,both,6,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,0,0.1,10,0.2,2.4,10,0.7,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Clinical scores are obtained from fig. 1,Nashold_2001_JN,JOUR,1,"Animals and Calcitriol/*pharmacology and Cell Differentiation/drug effects and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*prevention & control and Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*physiology and Mice and Mice, Inbred Strains and Mice, Knockout/genetics and Mice, Transgenic and Receptors, Calcitriol/metabolism and Th1 Cells/cytology/metabolism and Th2 Cells/cytology/metabolism",eng,0165-5728 (Print) 0165-5728,16-29,119,11525796,"Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison 53706, USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,45172,NLM,1582,"ASReview_relevant and Nashold, F E and Hoag, K A and Goverman, J and Hayes, C E and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Netherlands and 2001/08/30 and J Neuroimmunol. 2001 Sep 3;119(1):16-29. doi: 10.1016/s0165-5728(01)00360-5.","Rag-1-dependent cells are necessary for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) prevention of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,302

This hypothesis provided the impetus for the experiments reported here investigating mechanisms whereby 1,25-(OH)2D3 may inhibit murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Severe EAE was induced, 1,25-(OH)2D3 or mock treatment was administered, and clinical disease, histopathological disease, and encephalitogenic cells in the central nervous system (CNS) were analyzed within 24-72 h of the treatment. The mock-treated mice remained paralyzed (stage 3 EAE) while most hormone-treated animals regained the partial use of both hind limbs (stage 2 EAE) within 72 h of treatment. A histopathological examination showed the hormone-treated mice had a 50% decrease in white matter and meningeal inflammation at 72 h post treatment. A flow cytometric analysis of cell surface markers on spinal cord cells recovered 24 h post treatment showed the mock-treated mice with EAE had about 7.0 +/- 2.3 million Mac-1+ cells/cord, whereas the hormone-treated mice had about 2.1 +/- 2.6 million Mac-1+ cells/cord, which was not significantly different from the unmanipulated control mice. Otherwise, the flow cytometric analysis detected no significant differences between the groups with respect to CD4+ or CD8+ T cells or B cells or macrophages in draining lymph nodes or spinal cords. These results are discussed with regard to possible fates for the 5 million Mac-1+ cells that were rapidly lost from the inflamed CNS in the 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated mice, and the possible beneficial effect of hormone treatment in resolving acute MS.",10.1016/s0165-5728(99)00247-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0165-5728(99)00247-7,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,B10.PL,both,7,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,2,2.1,8,0.4,2.9,7,0.4,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Nashold_2000_JN,JOUR,2,"Animals and Apoptosis/drug effects and B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism and CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism and CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism and Calcitriol/*therapeutic use and Cell Count/drug effects and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug and therapy/immunology/pathology/physiopathology and Female and Flow Cytometry and Hindlimb/physiopathology and Lymph Nodes/drug effects/immunology/pathology and Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism and Macrophages/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism and Male and Mice and Paralysis/diagnosis/drug therapy and Spinal Cord/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology",eng,0165-5728 (Print) 0165-5728,171-9,103,10696912,"Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 53706, USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,44986,NLM,1638,"ASReview_relevant and Nashold, F E and Miller, D J and Hayes, C E and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Netherlands and 2000/03/04 and J Neuroimmunol. 2000 Mar 1;103(2):171-9. doi: 10.1016/s0165-5728(99)00247-7.","1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatment decreases macrophage accumulation in the CNS of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,303

MS prevalence decreases with increasing sunlight exposure, supporting our hypothesis that the sunlight-dependent hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)) is a natural inhibitor of autoimmune T cell responses in MS. We found that vitamin D(3) inhibited experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in intact female mice, but not in ovariectomized females or males. To learn whether 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) is essential for vitamin D(3)-mediated protection, ovariectomized female mice were given E(2) or placebo and evaluated for vitamin D(3)-mediated EAE resistance. Diestrus-level E(2) implants alone provided no benefit, but they restored vitamin D(3)-mediated EAE resistance in the ovariectomized females. Synergy between E(2) and vitamin D(3) occurred through vitamin D(3)-mediated enhancement of E(2) synthesis, as well as E(2)-mediated enhancement of vitamin D receptor expression in the inflamed CNS. In males, E(2) implants did not enable vitamin D(3) to inhibit EAE. The finding that vitamin D(3)-mediated protection in EAE is female-specific and E(2)-dependent suggests that declining vitamin D(3) supplies due to sun avoidance might be contributing to the rapidly increasing female gender bias in MS.

In the present work we have evaluated the ability of 1,25-D3 to inhibit chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) of the Lewis rat, when administered after the beginning of clinical signs. We observed a significant clinical improvement in 1,25-D3-treated rats. This effect was accompanied by a profound inhibition of CD4 antigen expression by central nervous system (CNS) infiltrating monocytes/macrophages and parenchymal microglia. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis performed at the time of the second attack evidenced a region-specific distribution of inflammatory cells. In the same way, some aspects of the effects exerted by 1,25-D3 appeared to vary depending on the region considered, namely spinal cord, brainstem, cerebellum, midbrain or anterior brain. Thus, in 1,25-D3-treated rats, we observed an almost complete inhibition of CD4 antigen expression in the granule cell layer and the adjacent white matter of the cerebellum as well as a marked decrease in the number of OX42-positive cells (macrophages and activated microglia) in anterior brain sections.

In the present study, we attempted to treat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by administration of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for MMP-2, MMP-9, and minocycline, all of which have MMP-inhibiting functions. Minocycline, but not siRNAs, significantly suppressed disease development. In situ zymography revealed that gelatinase activities were almost completely suppressed in the spinal cords of minocycline-treated animals, while significant gelatinase activities were measured in the EAE lesions of control animals. However, MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNAs and proteins in the spinal cords of treated rats were unexpectedly upregulated. At the same time, mRNA for tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMP)-1 and -2 were also upregulated. The EnzChek Gelatinase/Collagenase assay using tissue containing native MMPs and TIMPs demonstrated that gelatinase activity levels in the spinal cords of treated rats were suppressed to the same level as those in normal spinal cord tissues. Finally, double immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that MMP-9 immunoreactivities of treated rats were almost the same as those of control rats and that MMP-9 and TIMP-1 immunoreactivities were colocalized in the spinal cord. These findings suggest that minocycline administration does not suppress MMPs at mRNA and protein levels but that it suppresses gelatinase activities by upregulating TIMPs.

Microglia play a critical role in major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II)-dependent antigen presentation and in reactivation of CNS-infiltrated encephalitogenic T cells. Minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, has profound anti-inflammatory properties and is experimentally used for treatment of many CNS disorders; however, the mechanisms involved in minocycline effects remain unknown. We show that administration of minocycline for 2 weeks ameliorated clinical severity of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, an effect that partially involves the down-regulation of MHC II proteins in the spinal cord. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of minocycline inhibitory effects on MHC II expression in microglia. Although complex, the co-activator class II transactivator (CIITA) is a key regulator of MHC II expression. Here we show that minocycline inhibited interferon <ce><b3> (IFN<ce><b3>)-induced CIITA and MHC II mRNA. Interestingly, however, it was without effect on STAT1 phosphorylation or IRF-1 expression, transcription factors that are activated by IFN<ce><b3> and necessary for CIITA expression. Further experiments revealed that MHC II expression is down-regulated in the presence of the PKC<ce><b1> inhibitor G<c3><b6>6976. Minocycline inhibited IFN<ce><b3>-induced PKC <ce><b1>/<ce><b2>II phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of both PKC<ce><b1>/<ce><b2>II and IRF-1 that subsequently inhibits CIITA expression. Our present data delineate a molecular pathway of minocycline action that includes inhibitory effects on PKC<ce><b1>/<ce><b2>II and transcription factors that regulate the expression of critical inflammatory genes such as MHC II. Such a fundamental mechanism may underlie the pleiotropic effects of minocycline in CNS inflammatory disorders. <c2><a9> 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",10.1074/jbc.M611907200,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M611907200,WZ,1,NA,EAE,rat,"Dark Agouti, Sprague-Dawley",female,NA,Minocycline,control,1,NA,2,0.6,NA,0.6,2.7,NA,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Clinical scores are from Dark Agouti rats,Nikodemova_2007_JoofBiCh,JOUR,20,"12 (2 cyanoethyl) 6,7,12,13 tetrahydro 13 methyl 5 oxoindolo[2,3 a]pyrrolo[3,4 c]carbazole and gamma interferon and interferon regulatory factor 1 and major histocompatibility antigen class 2 and messenger RNA and minocycline and protein kinase C alpha and protein kinase C beta and STAT1 protein and transcription factor and autoimmune encephalomyelitis and animal cell and animal experiment and antiinflammatory activity and article and controlled study and down regulation and drug inhibition and female and macrophage migration inhibition and microglia and nonhuman and pleiotropy and priority journal and protein expression and protein phosphorylation and protein synthesis inhibition and rat and therapy effect",English,0021-9258 1083-351X,15208-15216,282,NA,"M.

We utilized a model of multiple sclerosis to determine the extent of demyelination and remyelination in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)infected SJL/J mice treated with mouse IFN-<ce><b1>/<ce><b2> for a short (5 weeks) or a long (16 weeks) period. All mice were chronically infected with TMEV to simulate the clinical situation in multiple sclerosis. Short-term IFN-<ce><b1>/<ce><b2> treatment increased the percent of remyelinated spinal cord white matter by threefold when compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) treatment (P < 0.02), but it did not affect the extent of demyelination. In contrast, long-term IFN- <ce><b1>/<ce><b2> treatment increased the extent of demyelination by twofold (P < 0.03). Long-term treatment increased the absolute area of remyelination, but the percent remyelination as a function of area of demyelination was not changed because of increased demyelination. An immunomodulatory mechanism may have contributed to the effect of IFN-<ce><b1>/<ce><b2> on white matter pathology because treated mice had higher anti-TMEV IgGs in serum and demonstrated decreased numbers of B and T lymphocytes infiltrating the central nervous system (CNS). There was no correlation between the level of anti- IFN-<ce><b1>/<ce><b2> antibodies and the extent of demyelination or remyelination. These results indicate that the length of type I IFN treatment may have paradoxical effects on demyelination and remyelination.

R.",2014,J Neuroimmunol,FTY720 impairs CD8 T-cell function independently of the sphingosine-1-phosphate pathway,"Fingolimod (FTY720) is a multiple sclerosis (MS) therapeutic that upon phosphorylation causes the internalization of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors (S1PR) and traps CCR7+ T-cells in lymph nodes but relatively spares CCR7-effector T-cells. Nonetheless, FTY720-treated patients are more susceptible to viral infections, indicating a CD8 T-cell defect. Thus, the effects of FTY720 on CD8 T-cells were investigated. To this end, we utilized experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and a murine influenza model. CD8 T-cell trafficking, IFN<ce><b3> and Granzyme B (GrB) production were assessed by flow cytometry. CD8 T-cell cytotoxic function was assessed in vitro by an LDH release assay. FTY720 not only ameliorated EAE by sequestering T-cells, but also reduced IFN<ce><b3> and Granzyme B (GrB) in splenic CD8 T-cells. Murine influenza infection was exacerbated and mortality was increased, as FTY720 inhibited CD8 T-cell GrB production and lung infiltration. Remarkably, only the unphosphorylated compound was able to reduce IFN<ce><b3> and GrB levels in CD8 T-cells and inhibits their cytotoxic function in vitro. The phosphorylated moiety had no effect in vitro, indicating that CD8 T-cell suppression by FTY720 is independent of S1PR modulation. The addition of arachidonic acid rescued CD8 T-cell function, suggesting that this effect may be mediated via inhibition of cytosolic phospholipase A2. Herein, we demonstrate that FTY720 suppresses CD8 T-cells independently of its trafficking effects and S1PR modulation. This provides a novel explanation not only for the increased rate of viral infections in FTY720-treated patients, but also for its efficacy in MS, as CD8 T-cells have emerged as crucial mediators of MS pathogenesis.",10.1016/j.jneuroim.2014.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2014.03.007,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,9,Fingolimod,control,3,NA,2,0.9,5,0,2.5,5,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ntranos_2014_JN,JOUR,44958,"Animals and CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology and Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*immunology and Female and Fingolimod Hydrochloride and Flow Cytometry and Granzymes/biosynthesis and Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology and Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype and Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis and Lysophospholipids/metabolism and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*immunology and Propylene Glycols/*pharmacology and Signal Transduction/drug effects and Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology and Autoimmunity and CD8+ T cells and Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and Fingolimod (FTY720) and Murine influenza and Viral infection",eng,0165-5728,13-21,270,24680062,"Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 600 N.

To study the effect of high-dose vitamin D on remyelination, female C57Bl/6 mice were demyelinated with dietary 0.2% cuprizone for 7 weeks. The mice received intraperitoneal injections of 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) or placebo (vehicle) injections twice a week, from week 6, throughout week 9. Mice that received calcitriol had initially increased demyelination (p = 0.021), astrocytosis (p = 0.043), and microglia activation. However, levels of astrocytosis and microglia activation dropped below those of the placebo group during the remyelination phase. There was a significant increase in myelination in the calcitriol group throughout the remyelination phase (p = 0.041), while the remyelination in the placebo group was not significant (p = 0.317). After 3 weeks of remyelination, the calcitriol group had more myelin than the placebo group (p = 0.001). The calcitriol group had a higher density of NOGO-A positive cells throughout the remyelination phase, and the number of NOGO-A positive cells was significantly higher in the calcitriol group at one week of remyelination (p = 0.019).

Most patients harbor pathogenic autoantibodies, the so-called NMO-IgGs, which are directed against the water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4) on astrocytes. When these antibodies gain access to the CNS, they mediate astrocyte destruction by complement-dependent and by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In contrast to multiple sclerosis (MS) patients who benefit from therapies involving type I interferons (I-IFN), NMO patients typically do not profit from such treatments. How is I-IFN involved in NMO pathogenesis? To address this question, we made gene expression profiles of spinal cords from Lewis rat models of experimental neuromyelitis optica (ENMO) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found an upregulation of I-IFN signature genes in EAE spinal cords, and a further upregulation of these genes in ENMO. To learn whether the local I-IFN signature is harmful or beneficial, we induced ENMO by transfer of CNS antigen-specific T cells and NMO-IgG, and treated the animals with I-IFN at the very onset of clinical symptoms, when the blood-brain barrier was open. With this treatment regimen, we could amplify possible effects of the I-IFN induced genes on the transmigration of infiltrating cells through the blood brain barrier, and on lesion formation and expansion, but could avoid effects of I-IFN on the differentiation of pathogenic T and B cells in the lymph nodes. We observed that I-IFN treated ENMO rats had spinal cord lesions with fewer T cells, macrophages/activated microglia and activated neutrophils, and less astrocyte damage than their vehicle treated counterparts, suggesting beneficial effects of I-IFN.",10.1371/journal.pone.0151244,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0151244,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,NA,7.5,Interferon Beta 1,control,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Oji_2016_PLoOne,JOUR,3,"Animals and B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology and Blood-Brain Barrier/*immunology/pathology and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/immunology/pathology and Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology and Interferon Type I/*immunology and Lymph Nodes/immunology/pathology and Macrophages/immunology/pathology and Microglia/immunology/pathology and Neuromyelitis Optica/*immunology/pathology and Neutrophils/immunology/pathology and Rats and Rats, Inbred Lew and Spinal Cord/*immunology/pathology and T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology",eng,1932-6203,e0151244,11,26990978,"Department of Neuroimmunology, Center for Brain Research, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.

D.",2009,Journal of Immunology,The innate immune response affects the development of the autoimmune response in Theiler's virus-induced demyelinating disease,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a human CNS autoimmune demyelinating disease. Epidemiological evidence has suggested a role for virus infection in the initiation and/or exacerbation of MS. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced demyelinating disease serves as a relevant mouse model for MS. TMEV-infected mice develop a demyelinating disease with clinical symptoms beginning around 35 days after infection, which is associated with development of myelin-specific, PLP139-151, CD4+ T cell responses. Viruses have been suggested to initiate autoimmune disease through bystander activation of immune cells or through bystander damage to tissue during infection. We examined the effect of the innate immune response on development of autoimmune demyelinating disease by altering the innate immune response through administration of innate immune cytokines, IFN-<ce><b1> or IFN-<ce><b2>, or antiserum against the type I IFNs during the innate immune response to TMEV. Administration of IFN-<ce><b2>, but not IFN-<ce><b1>, to TMEV- infected mice led to reduced myelin-specific CD4+ T cell responses and reduced demyelinating disease, which was associated with decreased immune cell infiltration into the CNS and increased expression of IL-10 in the CNS. Conversely, administration of antiserum to IFN-<ce><b2> led to a more severe demyelinating disease. In addition, administration of poly(I:C), which is an innate immune agonist, to TMEV-infected mice during the innate immune response resulted in decreased myelin-specific CD4+ T cell responses and reduced demyelinating disease. These results demonstrate that activating or enhancing the innate immune response can reduce the subsequent initiation and progression of the autoimmune response and demyelinating disease. <c2><a9> 2009 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.",10.4049/jimmunol.0801940,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.0801940,PH,1,NA,TMEV-IDD,mouse,SJL,female,5.5,Interferon Beta 1,control,1,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,BeAn- Strain of TMEV,Olson_2009_JoofIm,JOUR,9,alpha interferon and antiserum and beta interferon and CD4 antigen and interleukin 10 and myelin and polyinosinic polycytidylic acid and proteolipid protein and proteolipid protein[139-151] and unclassified drug and animal experiment and animal model and animal tissue and article and autoimmunity and bystander effect (cell) and CD4+ T lymphocyte and cell activation and cell infiltration and central nervous system and controlled study and demyelinating disease and disease course and disease exacerbation and disease severity and female and gene expression and immune response and immunocompetent cell and innate immunity and mouse and multiple sclerosis and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus and nonhuman and priority journal and symptom,English,0022-1767 1550-6606,5712-5722,182,NA,"J.

Both vitamin D(3) and 1, 25-dihydroxyviatmin-D(3) (calcitriol) had beneficial effects in EAE/MS. However, the exact cause of vitamin D deficiency in EAE/MS is not clear. Previously, we documented that lovastatin (LOV) provides protection in EAE animals via inhibition of RhoA-ROCK signaling. Herein, we demonstrate that LOV prevents the lowering of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin-D(3) and 1,25-dihydroxyviatmin-D(3) levels including 1,25-dihydroxyviatmin-D(3) levels in the peripheral lymphoid organs and CNS of treated EAE animals. These effects of LOV were attributed to enhanced expression of vitamin D synthesizing enzyme (1<ce><b1>-hydroxylase) in kidney and the CNS, with corresponding reduction of vitamin D catabolizing enzyme (24-hydorxylase) expression in the CNS of EAE animals via inhibition of RhoA-ROCK signaling. Ex vivo and in vitro studies established that autoreactive Th1/Th17 cells had higher expression of 24-hydroxylase than Th2/T regulatory cells, that was reverted by LOV or ROCK inhibitor. Interestingly, LOV-mediated regulation of vitamin D metabolism had improved vitamin D(3) efficacy to confer protection in EAE animals and that was ascribed to the LOV- and calcitriol-induced immunomodulatory synergy.

Although this molecule is thought to immunosuppress by inhibiting lymphocyte egress from the lymph nodes, the full spectrum of FTY720's actions has not yet been uncovered. In this study, we investigated the effects of FTY720 treatment on disease severity and histopathology of MOG-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the dark agouti (DA) rat, a model that closely mimics several features of MS. The effects of FTY720 on T-cell subsets, anti-MOG antibody production, and mRNA expression of a number of cytokines and other genes were also examined. Commencement of treatment before disease onset prevented the appearance of clinical disease. Therapeutic treatment after established disease reduced clinical scores and substantially attenuated inflammation, demyelination, and axon loss. EAE suppression was associated with a reduction in all measured T-cell subsets in blood and spleen and a significant decrease in serum IgG(2a) levels. However, in the lymph nodes, all T-cell subsets except for na<c3><af>ve T cells and recent thymic emigrants remained unaffected. In addition, FTY720 treatment led to a significant inhibition in interferon-gamma, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA expression in the MOG-EAE spinal cord.

We postulated that MMF exerts neuroprotective effects through modulation of microglia activation, a critical component of the neuroinflammatory cascade that occurs in neurodegenerative diseases such as MS. To ascertain our hypothesis and define the mechanistic pathways involved in the modulating effect of fumarates, we used real-time PCR and biochemical assays to assess changes in the molecular and functional phenotype of microglia, quantitative Western blotting to monitor activation of postulated pathway components, and ex vivo whole-cell patch clamp recording of excitatory post-synaptic currents in corticostriatal slices from mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for MS, to study synaptic transmission. We show that exposure to MMF switches the molecular and functional phenotype of activated microglia from classically activated, pro-inflammatory type to alternatively activated, neuroprotective one, through activation of the hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2). We validate a downstream pathway mediated through the AMPK-Sirt1 axis resulting in deacetylation, and thereby inhibition, of NF-<ce><ba>B and, consequently, of secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules. We demonstrate through ex vivo monitoring of spontaneous glutamate-mediated excitatory post-synaptic currents of single neurons in corticostriatal slices from EAE mice that the neuroprotective effect of DMF was exerted on neurons at pre-synaptic terminals by modulating glutamate release. By exposing control slices to untreated and MMF-treated activated microglia, we confirm the modulating effect of MMF on microglia function and, thereby, its indirect neuroprotective effect at post-synaptic level. These findings, whereby DMF-induced activation of a new HCAR2-dependent pathway on microglia leads to the modulation of neuroinflammation and restores synaptic alterations occurring in EAE, represent a possible novel mechanism of action for DMF in MS.",10.1007/s00401-015-1422-3,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-015-1422-3,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Dimethyl fumarate,control,1,NA,2,2,20,0.1,3,20,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Parodi_2015_ActaNeur,JOUR,2,"AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism and Animals and Brain/drug effects/physiopathology and Cell Line and Dose-Response Relationship, Drug and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/physiopathology and Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials/drug effects and Female and Fumarates/*pharmacology and Glutamic Acid/metabolism and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Microglia/*drug effects/physiology and NF-kappa B/metabolism and Neuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology and Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*metabolism and Receptors, Nicotinic/*metabolism and Signal Transduction/physiology and Sirtuin 1/metabolism and Synapses/*drug effects/physiology and Tissue Culture Techniques",eng,0001-6322 (Print) 0001-6322,279-95,130,25920452,"Department of Neurology, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.",NA,NA,NA,PMC4503882,Aug,NLM,705,"ASReview_relevant and 1432-0533 and Parodi, Benedetta and Rossi, Silvia and Morando, Sara and Cordano, Christian and Bragoni, Alberto and Motta, Caterina and Usai, Cesare and Wipke, Brian T and Scannevin, Robert H and Mancardi, Giovanni L and Centonze, Diego and Kerlero de Rosbo, Nicole and Uccelli, Antonio and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Germany and 2015/04/30 and Acta Neuropathol. 2015 Aug;130(2):279-95. doi: 10.1007/s00401-015-1422-3.

Possible Implications for the Inflammatory Response","Monomethyl fumarate (MMF), metabolite of dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an immunosuppressive drug approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), is a potent agonist for hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2), eliciting signals that dampen cell activation or lead to inflammation such as the skin flushing reaction that is one of the main side effects of the treatment, together with gastrointestinal inflammation. Our aim is to further understand the molecular basis underlying these differential effects of the drug. We have used wild-type and HCAR2 knock-out mice to investigate, in vitro and ex vivo under steady-state and pathological conditions, the HCAR2-mediated signaling pathways activated by MMF in dendritic cells (DC), which promote differentiation of T cells, and in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) where activation of a pro-inflammatory pathway, such as the cyclooxygenase-2 pathway involved in skin flushing, could underlie gastrointestinal side effects of the drug. To understand how DMF treatment might impact on gut inflammation induced by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model for MS, we have used 3D X-ray phase contrast tomography and flow cytometry to monitor possible intestinal alterations at morphological and immunological levels, respectively. We show that HCAR2 is a pleiotropically linked receptor for MMF, mediating activation of different pathways leading to different outcomes in different cell types, depending on experimental in-vitro and in-vivo conditions. In the small intestine of EAE-affected mice, DMF treatment affected migration of tolerogenic DC from lamina propria to mesenteric lymph nodes, and/or reverted their profile to pro-inflammatory, probably as a result of reduced expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase and transforming growth factor beta as well as the inflammatory environment. Nevertheless, DMF treatment did not amplify the morphological alterations induced by EAE. On the basis of our further understanding of MMF signaling through HCAR2, we suggest that the pleiotropic signaling of fumarate via HCAR2 should be addressed for its pharmaceutical relevance in devising new lead compounds with reduced inflammatory side effects.",10.3389/fimmu.2021.655212,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.655212,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Dimethyl fumarate,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Parodi_2021_FronImmu,JOUR,NA,"Animals and Biomarkers and Dendritic Cells/immunology/metabolism and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental and Fumarates/*pharmacology and Immunohistochemistry and Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology and Intestinal Mucosa/immunology/metabolism/pathology and Lymph Nodes/immunology/pathology and Mice and Mice, Knockout and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism and Multiple Sclerosis/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism and Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics/*metabolism and Signal Transduction/drug effects and dendritic cells and dimethyl fumarate and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 and intestinal epithelial cells and multiple sclerosis",eng,1664-3224,655212,12,34084164,"Neuroimmunology Laboratory, DINOGMI, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.

Cell viability was not significantly affected by this treatment. However, when concentrations of IFNgamma and/or TNFalpha having no deleterious effects per se on cell viability were added together with cuprizone, cell viability decreased significantly. In mitochondria isolated from cuprizone-treated glial cells, we observed a marked decrease in the activities of the various complexes of the respiratory chain, indicating a disruption of mitochondrial function. An enhancement in oxidant production was also observed in cuprizone and/or TNFalpha-treated oligodendroglial cells. In in vivo experiments, inhibition of microglial activation with minocycline prevented cuprizone-induced demyelination. Based on the above-mentioned results we suggest that these microglial cells appear to have a very active role in cuprizone-induced oligodendroglial cell death and demyelination, through the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",10.1007/s11064-006-9165-0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11064-006-9165-0,PH,1,NA,cuprizone,rat,Wistar,male,8,Minocycline,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Pasquini_2007_NeuRes,JOUR,2,"Animals and Cell Survival/*drug effects and Cells, Cultured and Culture Media, Conditioned and Cuprizone/*pharmacology and Demyelinating Diseases/chemically induced/prevention & control and Immunohistochemistry and Interferon-gamma/*metabolism and Male and Mice and Microglia/*metabolism and Minocycline/therapeutic use and Oligodendroglia/cytology/*drug effects and Rats and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism",eng,0364-3190 (Print) 0364-3190,279-92,32,17063394,"Departamento de QuÃ­mica BiolÃ³gica, Facultad de Farmacia y BioquÃ­mica, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Junin 956, Buenos Aires, C1113AAD, Argentina.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Feb,NLM,1365,"ASReview_relevant and Pasquini, L A and Calatayud, C A and Bertone U<c3><b1>a, A L and Millet, V and Pasquini, J M and Soto, E F and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2006/10/26 and Neurochem Res. 2007 Feb;32(2):279-92. doi: 10.1007/s11064-006-9165-0.

In support of the hypothesis that vitamin D3 may reduce MS risk and severity, we found that vitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) inhibited induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an MS model. To investigate how 1,25-(OH)2D3 could carry out anti-inflammatory functions, we administered 1,25-(OH)2D3 or a placebo to mice with EAE, and subsequently analyzed clinical disease, chemokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and recruitment of dye-labeled monocytes. The 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment significantly reduced clinical EAE severity within 3 days. Sharp declines in chemokines, inducible iNOS, and CD11b+ monocyte recruitment into the central nervous system (CNS) preceded this clinical disease abatement in the 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated animals. The 1,25-(OH)2D3 did not directly and rapidly inhibit chemokine synthesis in vivo or in vitro. Rather, the 1,25-(OH)2D3 rapidly stimulated activated CD4+ T cell apoptosis in the CNS and spleen. Collectively, these results support a model wherein inflammation stimulates a natural anti-inflammatory feedback loop. The activated inflammatory cells produce 1,25-(OH)2D3, and this hormone subsequently enhances the apoptotic death of inflammatory CD4+ T cells, removing the driving force for continued inflammation. In this way, the sunlight-derived hormone could reduce the risk of chronic CNS inflammation and autoimmune-mediated neurodegenerative disease.",10.1002/jnr.21382,https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.21382,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,B10.PL,NA,NA,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Pedersen_2007_JNR,JOUR,11,"Animals and Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology and Calcitriol/*pharmacology and Chemokines/*biosynthesis and Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*drug effects and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology and Immunohistochemistry and Mice and Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism and Neuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology and Nitric Oxide/metabolism and Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/drug effects/metabolism and Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction and Th1 Cells/drug effects/immunology and Vitamins/pharmacology",eng,0360-4012 (Print) 0360-4012,2480-90,85,17600374,"Department of Biochemistry, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,45153,NLM,1327,"ASReview_relevant and Pedersen, Laura B and Nashold, Faye E and Spach, Karen M and Hayes, Colleen E and DK 07665-08/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2007/06/30 and J Neurosci Res. 2007 Aug 15;85(11):2480-90. doi: 10.1002/jnr.21382.","1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 reverses experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by inhibiting chemokine synthesis and monocyte trafficking",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,332

Elevated levels of a critical inhibitor of the mammalian fibrinolitic system, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) have been demonstrated in human and animal models of MS. In experimental studies that resemble neuroinflammatory disease, PAI-1 deficient mice display preserved neurological structure and function compared to wild type mice, suggesting a link between the fibrinolytic pathway and MS. We previously identified a series of PAI-1 inhibitors on the basis of the 3-dimensional structure of PAI-1 and on virtual screening. These compounds have been reported to provide a number of in vitro and in vivo benefits but none was tested in CNS disease models because of their limited capacity to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The existing candidates were therefore optimized to obtain CNS-penetrant compounds. We performed an in vitro screening using a model of BBB and were able to identify a novel, low molecular PAI-1 inhibitor, TM5484, with the highest penetration ratio among all other candidates. Next, we tested the effects on inflammation and demyelination in an experimental allergic encephalomyelitis mice model. Results were compared to either fingolimod or 6<ce><b1>-methylprednisolone. Oral administration of TM5484 from the onset of signs, ameliorates paralysis, attenuated demyelination, and axonal degeneration in the spinal cord of mice. Furthermore, it modulated the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which plays a protective role in neurons against various pathological insults, and choline acetyltransferase, a marker of neuronal density. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential benefits of a novel PAI-1 inhibitor, TM5484, in the treatment of MS.",10.1371/journal.pone.0124510,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0124510,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,11,Fingolimod,control,1,NA,"1,2",1.3,9,0.3,2.8,9,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Pelisch_2015_PLoOne,JOUR,4,"Animals and Axons and Biological Availability and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism and Choline O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism and Collagen Type IV/metabolism and Demyelinating Diseases/drug therapy/*pathology and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology and Mice and Multiple Sclerosis/drug therapy/*pathology and Neurons/*drug effects/*pathology and Paralysis/drug therapy/etiology and Permeability and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1/*pharmacology and Psychomotor Performance/drug effects",eng,1932-6203,e0124510,10,25915660,"Department of Molecular Medicine and Therapy, United Centers for Advanced Research and Translational Medicine, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.

Here our aim is to evaluate the effects of C-Phycocyanin (C-Pc), a biliprotein from Spirulina platensis with anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties, in a chronic model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. C-Pc (2, 4 or 8 mg/kg i.p.) or IFN-beta (2000 IU, s.c.) was administered daily once a day or every other day, respectively, starting at disease onset, which differ among EAE mice between 11 and 15 days postinduction. Histological and immunohistochemistry (anti-Mac-3, anti-CD3 and anti-APP) assessments were performed in spinal cord in the postinduction time. Global gene expression in the brain was analyzed with the Illumina Mouse WG-6_V2 BeadChip microarray and the expression of particular genes, assessed by qPCR using the Fast SYBR Green RT-PCR Master Mix. Oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde, peroxidation potential, CAT/SOD ratio and GSH) were determined spectrophoto-metrically. Results showed that C-Pc ameliorates the clinical deterioration of animals, an effect that expresses the reduction of the inflammatory infiltrates invading the spinal cord tissue, the axonal preservation and the down-regulation of IL-17 expression in brain tissue and serum. C-Pc and IFN-beta improved the redox status in mice subjected to EAE, while microarray analysis showed that both treatments shared a common subset of differentially expressed genes, although they also differentially modulated another subset of genes. Specifically, C-Pc mainly modulated the expression of genes related to remyelination, gliogenesis and axon-glia processes. Taken together, our results indicate that C-Pc has significant therapeutic effects against EAE, mediated by the dynamic regulation of multiple biological processes.",10.1007/s11481-015-9642-9,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11481-015-9642-9,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Interferon Beta 1,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Pent.U.00C3..U.00B3.n.Rol_2016_JNP,JOUR,1,"Animals and Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology and Brain/drug effects/pathology and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*pathology and Female and Gene Expression/drug effects and Immunohistochemistry and Interferon-beta/*pharmacology and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Nerve Regeneration/*drug effects and Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology and Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis and Oxidative Stress/drug effects and Phycocyanin/*pharmacology and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction and Spinal Cord/drug effects/pathology and C-Phycocyanin and Eae and IFN-beta and Multiple sclerosis and Neuroregeneration and Remyelination",eng,1557-1890,153-67,11,26556034,"Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (CIGB), Ave. 31 e/ 158 y 190, CubanacÃ¡n, Playa, PO Box 6162, Havana, 10 600, Cuba. giselle.penton@infomed.sld.cu.

Blocking LINGO-1 function leads to robust remyelination. The anti-LINGO-1 Li81 antibody is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for multiple sclerosis (MS) and is the first MS therapy that directly targets myelin repair. LINGO-1 is selectively expressed in brain and spinal cord but not in peripheral tissues. Perhaps the greatest concern for Li81 therapy is the limited access of the drug to the CNS. Here, we measured Li81 concentrations in brain, spinal cord, and cerebral spinal fluid in rats after systemic administration and correlated them with dose-efficacy responses in rat lysolecithin and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis spinal cord models of remyelination. Remyelination was dose-dependent, and levels of Li81 in spinal cord that promoted myelination correlated well with affinity measurements for the binding of Li81 to LINGO-1. Observed Li81 concentrations in the CNS of 0.1 to 0.4% of blood levels are consistent with values reported for other antibodies. To understand the features of the antibody that affect CNS penetration, we also evaluated the pharmacokinetics of Li81 Fab2, Fab, and poly(ethylene glycol)-modified Fab. The reagents all showed similar CNS exposure despite large differences in their sizes, serum half-lives, and volumes of distribution, and area under the curve (AUC) measurements in the CNS directly correlated with AUC measurements in serum. These studies demonstrate that exposure levels achieved by passive diffusion of the Li81 monoclonal antibody into the CNS are sufficient and lead to robust remyelination.",10.1124/jpet.111.183483,https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.111.183483,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Brown Norway,female,NA,Opicinumab,control,1,NA,2,1.3,10,0.2,2,10,0.3,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,age=adult,Pepinsky_2011_JPET,JOUR,2,"Animals and Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & and dosage/chemistry/immunology/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology and Blood-Brain Barrier/metabolism and Brain/metabolism and Cerebrospinal Fluid/chemistry and Disease Models, Animal and Dose-Response Relationship, Drug and Drug Evaluation, Preclinical and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism and Female and Lysophosphatidylcholines and Male and Membrane Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*immunology/metabolism and Nerve Tissue Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*immunology/metabolism and Rats and Rats, Long-Evans and Rats, Sprague-Dawley and Regeneration and Spinal Cord/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology",eng,0022-3565,519-29,339,21807883,"Department of Drug and Molecular Discovery, Biogen Idec, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02142, USA. blake.pepinsky@biogenidec.com",NA,NA,NA,NA,Nov,NLM,1034,"ASReview_relevant and 1521-0103 and Pepinsky, R Blake and Shao, Zhaohui and Ji, Benxiu and Wang, Qin and Meng, Gym and Walus, Lee and Lee, Xinhua and Hu, Yinghui and Graff, Christilyn and Garber, Ellen and Meier, Werner and Mi, Sha and Journal Article and United States and 2011/08/03 and J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2011 Nov;339(2):519-29. doi: 10.1124/jpet.111.183483.

Surprisingly, combined anti-CD80 + anti-CD86 monoclonal antibody injection on day 2 resulted in marked exacerbation of disease.

These results suggest distinct roles for CD80 and CD86 in the initiation of EAE, resulting in the diverse clinical outcomes observed in this model of EAE.",10.1016/0165-5728(95)00172-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-5728(95)00172-7,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,(PLxSJL)F1,female,11,Abatacept,control,3,NA,1,0.9,7,NA,3.5,7,NA,mean,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Perrin_1996_JN,JOUR,1,"Abatacept and Animals and Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology and Antigens, CD/*immunology and Antigens, Differentiation/*pharmacology and B7-1 Antigen/*immunology and B7-2 Antigen and CTLA-4 Antigen and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology/prevention & and control and Female and Guinea Pigs and Immunization and *Immunoconjugates and Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology and Interferon-gamma/immunology/metabolism and Interleukin-2/immunology/metabolism and Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology and Mice and Mice, Inbred Strains and Myelin Basic Protein/immunology and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology/metabolism and Virulence Factors, Bordetella/immunology",eng,0165-5728 (Print) 0165-5728,31-9,65,8642061,"Immune Cell Biology Program, Naval Medical Research Institute, Bethesda, MD 20889-5607, USA. rinOpjp@bumed30.navy.med.mil",NA,NA,NA,NA,Mar,NLM,1777,"ASReview_relevant and Perrin, P J and Scott, D and Davis, T A and Gray, G S and Doggett, M J and Abe, R and June, C H and Racke, M K and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. and Netherlands and 1996/03/01 and J Neuroimmunol. 1996 Mar;65(1):31-9. doi: 10.1016/0165-5728(95)00172-7.",Opposing effects of CTLA4-Ig and anti-CD80 (B7-1) plus anti-CD86 (B7-2) on experimental allergic encephalomyelitis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,336

The present studies were designed to test whether the loss of tolerance to myelin basic protein (MBP) requires costimulation by members of the B7 receptor family. CTLA-4Ig, a fusion protein ligand for B7-1 and B7-2, was used to assess the role of B7-mediated costimulation in chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by the transfer of MBP specific T cell lines. In adoptively transferred EAE, administering CTLA-4Ig to donor mice or during in vitro activation of MBP specific-T cells resulted in diminution of clinical disease. The presence of CTLA-4Ig during both the immunization and in vitro activation stages was most effective in preventing clinical signs of disease. This diminution in clinical disease was paralleled by a decreased proliferative response and reduced production of IL-2 and IL-4, but not IFN-gamma, after antigenic stimulation of encephalitogenic T cells in vitro. In contrast, CTLA-4Ig treatment of recipient animals after the transfer of MBP-activated T cells affected neither disease course nor severity. These results indicate that additional costimulatory pathways may be involved in established EAE, or that some cells are independent of costimulation or, alternatively, that CTLA-4Ig does not enter brain parenchyma in therapeutic concentrations. Thus, we conclude that costimulation provided by B7 molecules plays a major role in the development of encephalitogenic T cells and in the establishment of chronic relapsing EAE, a prototypic CD4+ T cell-mediated autoimmune disease.",NA,https://doi.org/,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SJL,female,11,Abatacept,control,1,NA,"1,2",0.6,5,NA,2.1,5,NA,mean,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Perrin_1995_JI,JOUR,3,"Abatacept and Animals and Antigens, CD and Antigens, Differentiation/*immunology and Apoptosis and B7-1 Antigen/*immunology and CD28 Antigens/immunology and CTLA-4 Antigen and Chronic Disease and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*immunology and Female and Immunization, Passive and *Immunoconjugates and Immunotherapy, Adoptive and Lymphocyte Activation/immunology and Lymphokines/metabolism and Mice and Mice, Inbred Strains and Polymerase Chain Reaction and Recurrence",eng,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767,1481-90,154,7529805,"Immune Cell Biology Program, Naval Medical Research Institute, Bethesda, MD 20889.",NA,NA,NA,NA,44958,NLM,1799,"ASReview_relevant and Perrin, P J and Scott, D and Quigley, L and Albert, P S and Feder, O and Gray, G S and Abe, R and June, C H and Racke, M K and Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. and United States and 1995/02/01 and J Immunol. 1995 Feb 1;154(3):1481-90.",Role of B7:CD28/CTLA-4 in the induction of chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,337

MATERIALS AND METHODS: EAE was induced in 36 female Hartley guinea pigs, and the treatment period was from day 11 to day 17 post-immunization. Animals received either saline (n = 12), anti-alpha4 integrin antibody (AN100226m; n = 12) or CT301 (n = 12). T2-weighted fast spin echo and T1-weighted pre- and post-contrast scans were performed at the beginning (day 11) and end (day 18) of the treatment period, and scored for cerebral inflammation and gadolinium enhancement. T1-weighted images were further analyzed to quantify this enhancement as a measure of blood-brain barrier integrity. Dissected CNS was evaluated for inflammation and demyelination. RESULTS: CT301 successfully reversed two clinical indicators of disease over the course of the treatment period. These animals showed decreased T2-weighted abnormalities, as well as a reduction in gadolinium leakage on T1-weighted images. Meningeal and perivascular inflammation was decreased by anti-alpha4 integrin treatments. CONCLUSION: CT301 effectively reverses the clinical, pathological and MR-detectable deficits of acute EAE, and may therefore be a promising therapeutic agent in multiple sclerosis (MS).",10.1191/1352458505ms1223oa,https://doi.org/10.1191/1352458505ms1223oa,PH,1,NA,EAE,guinea pig,Hartley,female,NA,Natalizumab,control,1,36,1,0.2,12,0.1,1.3,12,0.3,"mean, SEM",1,12,0.3,1.6,12,0.2,"mean, SEM",gadolinium,NA,eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.8,12,0.2,1.4,12,0.3,"mean, SEM",T2,NA,622,12,20,698,12,17,"mean, SEM",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Marketed,NA,338

We thus investigated whether memory impairment encountered at the early stage of the disease could be explained by a differential vulnerability of particular hippocampal subfields. By using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, we identified that early memory impairment was associated with selective alteration of the dentate gyrus as pinpointed in vivo with diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI). Neuromorphometric analyses and electrophysiological recordings confirmed dendritic degeneration, alteration in glutamatergic synaptic transmission and impaired long-term synaptic potentiation selectively in the dentate gyrus, but not in CA1, together with a more severe pattern of microglial activation in this subfield. Systemic injections of the microglial inhibitor minocycline prevented DTI, morphological, electrophysiological and behavioral impairments in EAE-mice. Furthermore, daily infusions of minocycline specifically within the dentate gyrus were sufficient to prevent memory impairment in EAE-mice while infusions of minocycline within CA1 were inefficient. We conclude that early memory impairment in EAE is due to a selective disruption of the dentate gyrus associated with microglia activation.

The exact mechanism of action by which teriflunomide exerts these effects is currently unknown. We assessed the effect of teriflunomide on brain glial cells in the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) by using a histological approach in combination with neuroimaging. METHODS: Forty-eight SJL female mice received an intracerebral injection of TMEV at 6-8 weeks of age and were then treated with teriflunomide (n = 24) or placebo (n = 24) for 9 months. They were examined with MRI and behavioral testing at 2, 6, and 9 months postinduction (mPI). Of those, 18 teriflunomide-treated and 17 controls mice were analyzed histologically at 9 mPI to sample from different brain regions for myelination status, microglial density, and oligodendroglial lineage. The histological and MRI outcomes were correlated. RESULTS: Corpus callosum microglial density was numerically lower in the teriflunomide-treated mice compared to the control group (141.1 <c2><b1> 21.7 SEM vs. 214.74 <c2><b1> 34.79 SEM, Iba1(+) cells/mm(2) , P = .087). Basal ganglia (BG) microglial density in the teriflunomide group exhibited a negative correlation with fractional anisotropy (P = .021) and a positive correlation with mean diffusivity (P = .034), indicating less inflammation and axonal damage. Oligodendroglial lineage cell and myelin density were not significantly different between treatment groups. However, a significant positive correlation between BG oligodendrocytes and BG volume (P = .027), and with N-acetyl aspartate concentration (P = .008), was found in the teriflunomide group, indicating less axonal loss. CONCLUSION: Teriflunomide altered microglia density and oligodendrocytes differentiation, which was associated with less evident microstructural damage on MRI.",10.1111/jon.12561,https://doi.org/10.1111/jon.12561,PH,1,NA,TMEV-IDD,mouse,SJL,female,7,Teriflunomide,control,1,48,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Pol_2019_JN,JOUR,1,"Animals and Corpus Callosum/*diagnostic imaging/pathology and Crotonates/*pharmacology and Demyelinating Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/pathology and Disease Models, Animal and Female and Hydroxybutyrates and Mice and Neuroglia/*drug effects/pathology and Neuroimaging and Nitriles and Theilovirus and Toluidines/*pharmacology and Mri and Tmev and histology and multiple sclerosis and teriflunomide",eng,1051-2284,52-61,29,30232810,"Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center, Department of Neurology, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY.

To assess the role of intracytoplasmic estrogen receptors in mediating suppression of EAE, we studied mice with disrupted estrogen receptor-(Esr1) and -<ce><b2> (Esr2) genes. We demonstrate that the protective effect of E2 is abrogated in B6.129-Esr1tm1Unc mice (Esr1-/-) but not in B6.129-Esr2 tm1Unc mice (Esr2-/-). The loss of E2-mediated protection from EAE in Esr1-/- mice immunized with the encephalitogenic MOG-35-55 peptide was manifested phenotypically by the development of severe acute clinical signs and histopathological lesions even in the presence of moderately high serum E2 levels. This is in contrast to C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice and Esr2-/- mice in which E2 treatment resulted in comparable serum levels and markedly suppressed clinical signs of EAE and abolished inflammatory lesions in the CNS. This pattern showing a lack of E2-dependent inhibition of EAE in Esr1-/- mice was mirrored by an enhanced rather than a reduced secretion of TNF-<ce><b1>, IFN-<ce><b1>, and interleukin (IL)-6 in MOG-specific splenocytes and a lack of inhibition of message for inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and chemokine receptors in CNS tissue.

In view of the complex pathogenesis and the relapsing and progressive nature of MS, combination therapy, a classical approach to treat many chronic diseases, could improve disease control over monotherapy. Ponesimod, a selective and rapidly reversible sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor Type 1 (S1P1) modulator, currently in Phase III clinical trial stage in relapsing MS (RMS), and dimethyl fumarate (DMF) would potentially be an ideal combination due to their differing mechanisms of action and oral administration. Objective: The goal of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of ponesimod monotherapy and investigate the potential additive, or synergistic, activity of ponesimod-DMF combination therapy in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal models of MS. Methods: Efficacy was evaluated in the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE model in C57BL/6 mice (ponesimod monotherapy) and in the myelin basic protein (MBP)-induced EAE model in Lewis rats (monotherapies and combination therapy). The principal readout was the clinical score assessing paralysis. Additional readouts, such as histopathology, survival, and disease prevalence, were generated in parallel when applicable. Results: Ponesimod monotherapy in the mouse EAE model showed significant efficacy in both preventative and therapeutic settings. In the rat EAE model, ponesimod demonstrated significant dose-dependent efficacy on clinical scores, while DMF showed only modest activity. Combination therapy synergistically reduced the severity and prevalence of disease. Only the combination treatment of ponesimod and DMF fully suppressed clinical disease activity by the end of the study. Conclusion: The results support the potential therapeutic benefits of combining ponesimod with DMF to improve disease activity control in patients with MS. Additionally, the results suggest that combining ponesimod with other oral agents that have different mechanisms of action might also be therapeutically beneficial to patients with MS.",NA,https://doi.org/,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,NA,Ponesimod,control,1,NA,"1,2",3.3,15,0.3,4.9,10,0,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Pouzol_2019_InnoClinNeur,JOUR,45019,Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and combination therapy and dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and disease activity and multiple sclerosis (MS) and sphingosine-1-phosphate,eng,2158-8333 (Print) 2158-8333,22-30,16,31214480,"Drs.

MMPs are also involved in destruction of myelin sheaths, leading to axonal and neuronal loss. The aim of the present study was to assess whether natalizumab, a transmigration-inhibiting monoclonal antibody against <ce><b1>4<ce><b2>1 integrin, influences expression of MMPs and TIMPs in the central nervous system of mice with EAE. MMP-2 and MMP-9, their respective inhibitors TIMP-2 and TIMP-1 and laminin were assessed by quantitative immunohistochemistry in the spinal cord cryosections of C57BL/6 mice with EAE in the successive phases of the disease (onset, peak and chronic). The percentage of immunopositive areas were calculated in sections encompassing the whole spinal cord cross-sectional area occupied by the gray and white matter. Results obtained in animals administered with 5 mg/kg natalizumab were compared with those collected from control mice receiving 5 mg/kg IgG. Both studied MMPs and both TIMPs were upregulated in control EAE mice. Natalizumab treatment significantly reduced expression of MMPs and increased expression of TIMPs in the peak and chronic phases of the disease. This effect was accompanied by inhibition of laminin degradation in the vascular basal laminae and reduction of inflammatory infiltration. Results of this study demonstrate that in addition to its well known anti-integrin activity counteracting transmigration of immune cells into the central nervous system, natalizumab strengthens this effect by its probably indirect influence on MMPs and TIMPs leading to protection of blood-brain barrier integrity.",10.26402/jpp.2020.2.11,https://doi.org/10.26402/jpp.2020.2.11,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,10.5,Natalizumab,control,1,40,2,1,5,0.1,2.7,5,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Pyka.Fosciak_2020_JPP,JOUR,2,"Animals and Blood-Brain Barrier/drug effects and Central Nervous System/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug and therapy/immunology/metabolism/pathology and Female and Immunologic Factors/pharmacology and Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/*metabolism and Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*metabolism and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Natalizumab/*pharmacology and Spinal Cord/drug effects/metabolism/pathology and Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/*metabolism and Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2/*metabolism",eng,0867-5910,NA,71,32776909,"Department of Histology, Faculty of Medicine Jagiellonian University Medical College, Cracow, Poland. gpfosciak@cm-uj.krakow.pl.

There is still lack of effective treatments currently. Pien Tze Huang (PZH), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, has been proved to have anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and immunoregulatory effects. However, whether PZH can be used to treat MS is still obscure. This study aimed to investigate the possible therapeutic effect and the underlying action mechanism of PZH in relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (RR-EAE) mice. Female SJL/J mice were immunized with myelin proteolipid protein 139-151 (PLP(139-151)) and pertussis toxin to establish RR-EAE model. Mice were then randomly divided into normal group, model group, PZH group and positive control group (fingolimod, FTY-720), and drugs were orally administered for 60 days from the day 10 after immunization. Sera of mice were collected for ELISA detection. Tissues of CNS were harvested for hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) and luxol fast blue (LFB) staining. Furthermore, Th1, Th17 cells and their related cytokines in the CNS were detected by flow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively. Proteins involved in STAT and NF-<ce><ba>B signaling pathways were detected by western blot. The results showed that PZH-treated mice displayed mild or moderate clinical symptoms compared with untreated EAE mice that exhibited severe clinical symptoms. PZH remarkably reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and myelin damage in the CNS of EAE mice. It markedly down-regulated the levels of IFN-<ce><b3> and IL-17A in sera of EAE mice. Moreover, PZH could reduce the percentages of Th1 and Th17 cells. It also suppressed the production of transcription factors ROR-<ce><b3>t and T-bet as well as the mRNA levels of their downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-<ce><b3> and IL-17A. Furthermore, PZH could inhibit the phosphorylation of some key proteins in the STAT and NF-<ce><ba>B signaling pathways. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that PZH had a therapeutic effect on RR-EAE mice, which was associated with the modulation effect on Th1 and Th17 cells.",10.3389/fphar.2018.01237,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2018.01237,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SJL,female,7,Fingolimod,control,1,40,1,1.5,10,1.3,4.3,10,0.3,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Qiu_2018_FronPhar,JOUR,NA,Pien Tze Huang and Th1 cells and Th17 cells and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis,eng,1663-9812 (Print) 1663-9812,1237,9,30429789,"Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.

Here, the design and optimization of novel [1,2,4]oxadiazole derivatives as selective S1P receptor agonists are described. The structure-activity relationship exploration was carried out on the three dominant segments of the series: modification of the polar head group (P), replacement of the oxadiazole linker (L) with different five-membered heterocycles, and the use of diverse 2,2<e2><80><b2>-disubstituted biphenyl moieties as the hydrophobic tail (H). All three segments have a significant impact on potency, S1P receptor subtype selectivity, physicochemical properties, and in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) profile of the compounds.

These compounds distribute predominantly in lymph nodes and brain over plasma and induce long lasting decreases in lymphocyte count after oral administration. When evaluated head-to-head in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model, together with the marketed drug fingolimod, a pan-S1P receptor agonist, S1P1,5 agonist 49 demonstrated comparable efficacy while S1P1-selective agonist 45 was less potent.

Here, we explore the hypothesis that systemic inflammation occurring in autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), can generate a disease-specific environment able to alter the functionality of tolDC. In this context in fact, a combined therapy of tolDC with an immunomodulatory treatment could potentiate the beneficial effect of this antigen-specific cell therapy. For this purpose, we analyzed the efficacy of a combined therapy based on the use of vitamin D3 (VitD3)-tolDC plus interferon beta (IFN-beta) in MS. VitD3-tolDC were generated from healthy donors and MS patients and co-cultured with allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells, in the presence or absence of IFN-beta. In vitro, VitD3-tolDC treatment reduced the percentage of activated T cells and allogeneic proliferation, whereas VitD3-tolDC+IFN-beta treatment enhanced the suppressive ability of VitD3-tolDC and, additionally, induced a shift towards a Th2 profile. To determine the clinical benefit of the combined therapy, C57BL/6-experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-induced mice were treated with antigen-specific VitD3-tolDC and/or IFN-beta. Treatment of EAE mice with combined therapy ameliorated the disease course compared to each monotherapy.

FGFR signaling proteins associated with inflammation/degeneration in MS/EAE were analyzed by western blot in the spinal cord. Further, FGFR1 in Oli-neu oligodendrocytes were inhibited by PD166866 and treated with IFN<ce><b2>-1a (400 ng/mL). Application of IFN<ce><b2>-1a over 8 days resulted in less symptoms only at the peak of disease (days 9-11) compared to controls. Application of IFN<ce><b2>-1a in Fgfr1(ind)(-/-) mice resulted in less symptoms primarily in the chronic phase of EAE.

Experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) is a model of the disease. MS is classically treated with interferon beta (IFN-<ce><b2>) and glatiramer acetate (GA). Melatonin (MLT) has been reported to modulate immune system responses. The aim of the present study is to analyse the effects of MLT administration in comparison with the first-line treatments for MS (IFN-<ce><b2> and GA). METHODS: EAE was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats; the animals subsequently received either IFN-<ce><b2>, GA, or MLT. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were analysed by multiplex assay to determine the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. The neurological evaluation of EAE was also recorded. RESULTS: All immunised animals developed EAE. We evaluated the first relapse-remission cycle, observing that IFN-<ce><b2> and GA had better results than MLT in the clinical evaluation. Neither EAE nor any of the treatments administered modified CSF IL-1<ce><b2> and IL-12p70 concentrations. However, IFN-<ce><b2> and MLT did decrease CSF TNF-<ce><b1> concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to evaluate the molecular mechanisms involved in the behaviour of MLT in EAE, and to quantify other cytokines in different biological media in order for MLT to be considered an anti-inflammatory agent capable of regulating MS.",10.1016/j.nrl.2018.01.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2018.01.007,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Sprague-Dawley,male,8.6,Glatiramer acetate,control,3,128,1,0,16,0,10,16,0,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ramos.Gonz.U.00C3..U.00A1.lez_2021_Neu.EnEd.,JOUR,4,"Animals and Glatiramer Acetate/therapeutic use and *Immunomodulation and Interferon-beta and Male and *Melatonin/therapeutic use and Mice and *Multiple Sclerosis/drug therapy and Rats and Rats, Sprague-Dawley and Acetato de glatir<c3><a1>mero and Eae and Encefalitis autoinmune experimental and Esclerosis m<c3><ba>ltiple and Glatiramer acetate and Immunomodulators and Inmunomoduladores and Interferon beta and Interfer<c3><b3>n beta and Melatonin and Melatonina and Multiple sclerosis",eng spa,2173-5808,262-270,36,29526318,"Departamento de FisiologÃ­a, Centro Universitario Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Jalisco, MÃ©xico; DivisiÃ³n de Neurociencias, Centro de InvestigaciÃ³n BiomÃ©dica de Occidente, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Guadalajara, Jalisco, MÃ©xico.

In this regard small-molecule antagonists can have a wide range of impacts, so in this research, we examine the prophylactic effects of BIO-1211 [Very Late Antigen-4 (VLA4) blocker], in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis in comparison with commercial available medicine, Natalizumab (NTZ)]. METHODS: EAE was induced by subcutaneous immunization of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35-55) in 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice. During EAE induction, mice were separated to distinct groups and provided either BIO-1211 (5 and 10<e2><80><89>mg/kg) or NTZ (5<e2><80><89>mg/kg) and co-administration of these two compounds. After 21 days, neuro-inflammatory responses were analyzed using qRT-PCR, western blot, and ELISA methods. Pervade of immune cells to brain was examined by Evans blue staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of specific markers of microglia/monocytes (CD11b) and leukocytes (CD45). RESULTS: Targeted disruption of VLA4/VCAM1 interactions, by BIO-1211 agonist in mice, results in reduced cytokines expression, leukocyte trafficking, and inhibition of inflammatory responses in EAE (p<e2><80><89><<e2><80><89>0.01) in a dose-independent manner (data not shown). Mice treated with both BIO-1211 and NTZ exhibited a considerable depletion in the EAE clinical score, which correlated with decreased expression of TNF-<ce><b1>, IL-17, IFN-<ce><b3> and pervade of CD11b(+) and CD45(+) cells into the cerebral cortex. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that BIO12-11 compound would be an useful tool to further understand the biological roles of VLA4/VCAM1 interactions, and could also be considered as EAE-suppressing agent.",10.3109/08820139.2015.1085391,https://doi.org/10.3109/08820139.2015.1085391,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,male,8,Natalizumab,control,1,120,"0,1",0.7,20,0.5,3.5,20,0.5,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ramroodi_2015_ImmuInve,JOUR,7,"Animals and Blood-Brain Barrier/drug effects/metabolism and CD11b Antigen/metabolism and Cell Movement/immunology and Cerebral Cortex/immunology/metabolism/pathology and Cytokines/genetics/metabolism and Disease Models, Animal and Disease Progression and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/drug and therapy/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology and Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects and Inflammation Mediators/metabolism and Integrin alpha4beta1/*antagonists & inhibitors and Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism and Leukocytes/immunology/metabolism and Male and Mice and Monocytes/immunology/metabolism and Multiple Sclerosis/drug therapy/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology and Nitro Compounds and Oligopeptides/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology and Permeability/drug effects and RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism and Thiazoles/administration & dosage/pharmacology and Bio-1211 and Eae and Vla4 and multiple sclerosis and neuro-inflammation",eng,0882-0139,694-712,44,26436854,"a Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine , Zahedan University of Medical Sciences , Zahedan , Iran . b Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine , Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran . c Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences , University of Zabol , Zabol , Iran . d Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine , Zabol University of Medical Sciences , Zabol , Iran . e Department of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science Research Center , Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran . f Department of Chemical Engineering , Babol Noushirvani University of Technology , Babol , Iran . g Department of Biology, Faculty of Science , Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman , Kerman , Iran , and. h Department of Pharmacy , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NLM,673,"ASReview_relevant and 1532-4311 and Ramroodi, Nourollah and Khani, Masood and Ganjali, Zohre and Javan, Mohammad Reza and Sanadgol, Nima and Khalseh, Roghayeh and Ravan, Hadi and Sanadgol, Ehsan and Abdollahi, Mohammad and Journal Article and England and 2015/10/06 and Immunol Invest. 2015;44(7):694-712. doi: 10.3109/08820139.2015.1085391.",Prophylactic Effect of BIO-1211 Small-Molecule Antagonist of VLA-4 in the EAE Mouse Model of Multiple Sclerosis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Marketed,NA,351

In a relapsing-remitting model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the neural stem cells (NSCs) become activated and initiate regeneration during acute disease, but lose this ability during the chronic phases of disease. We hypothesized that chronic microglia activation contributes to the failure of the NSC repair potential in the SVZ. METHODS: Using bromodeoxyuridine injections at different time points during EAE, we quantified the number of proliferating and differentiating progenitors, and evaluated the structure of the SVZ by electron microscopy. In vivo minocycline treatment during EAE was used to address the effect of microglia inactivation on SVZ dysfunction. RESULTS: In vivo treatment with minocycline, an inhibitor of microglia activation, increases stem cell proliferation in both naive and EAE animals. Minocycline treatment decreases cortical and periventricular pathology in the chronic phase of EAE, improving the proliferation of Sox2 stem cells and NG2 oligodendrocyte precursors cells originating in the SVZ and their differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes. INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that failure of repair observed during chronic EAE correlates with microglia activation and that treatments targeting chronic microglial activation have the potential for enhancing repair in the CNS.",10.1002/ana.22299,https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.22299,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SJL,NA,NA,Minocycline,control,1,NA,2,0.3,10,0.4,1.2,10,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rasmussen_2011_AnnNeu,JOUR,5,"Animals and Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology and Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism and Cell Count/methods and Cell Movement/drug effects and Cell Proliferation/drug effects and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/chemically induced/drug and therapy/*pathology/physiopathology and Mice and Microglia/drug effects/pathology/ultrastructure and Microscopy, Electron, Transmission and Minocycline/pharmacology and Multiple Sclerosis and Myelin Proteolipid Protein/adverse effects and Neural Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology/ultrastructure and Oligodendroglia/drug effects/physiology and Peptide Fragments/adverse effects and Secondary Prevention and Stem Cell Niche/drug effects/*pathology and Time Factors",eng,0364-5134 (Print) 0364-5134,878-91,69,21391234,"Center for Neurologic Diseases, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.",NA,NA,NA,PMC3082630,May,NLM,1078,"ASReview_relevant and 1531-8249 and Rasmussen, Stine and Imitola, Jaime and Ayuso-Sacido, Angel and Wang, Yue and Starossom, Sarah C and Kivis<c3><a4>kk, Pia and Zhu, Bing and Meyer, Morten and Bronson, Roderick T and Garcia-Verdugo, Jose Manuel and Khoury, Samia J and R01 AI071448-04/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and R01 AI043496/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and R01 AI043496-09/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and AI46374/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and R01 AI071448/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and AI043496/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and U19 AI046374/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2011/03/11 and Ann Neurol. 2011 May;69(5):878-91. doi: 10.1002/ana.22299.

We have shown that MS patients have increased numbers of GM-CSF(+) Th cells in circulation, and that IFN-<ce><b2> therapy reduces their numbers. GM-CSF expression by myelin-specific Th cells is essential for the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. These findings suggested that IFN-<ce><b2> therapy may function via suppression of GM-CSF production by Th cells. In the current study, we elucidated a feedback loop between monocytes and Th cells that amplifies autoimmune neuroinflammation, and found that IFN-<ce><b2> therapy ameliorates central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity by inhibiting this proinflammatory loop. IFN-<ce><b2> suppressed GM-CSF production in Th cells indirectly by acting on monocytes, and IFN-<ce><b2> signaling in monocytes was required for EAE suppression. IFN-<ce><b2> increased IL-10 expression by monocytes, and IL-10 was required for the suppressive effects of IFN-<ce><b2>. IFN-<ce><b2> treatment suppressed IL-1<ce><b2> expression by monocytes in the CNS of mice with EAE. GM-CSF from Th cells induced IL-1<ce><b2> production by monocytes, and, in a positive feedback loop, IL-1<ce><b2> augmented GM-CSF production by Th cells. In addition to GM-CSF, TNF and FASL expression by Th cells was also necessary for IL-1<ce><b2> production by monocyte.

Established therapies target primarily the inflammatory component of the disease, but fail to prevent neurodegeneration. Fingolimod (codenamed FTY720) is an oral sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator with promising results in phase II trials in multiple sclerosis patients and is under further development as a novel treatment for multiple sclerosis. To evaluate whether FTY720 has neuroprotective properties, we tested this drug in a rat model of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced optic neuritis. FTY720 exerted significant anti-inflammatory effects during optic neuritis and reduced inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage; however, FTY720 treatment did not prevent apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the neurons that form the axons of the optic nerve. Consistent with this lack of effect on RGC survival, FTY720 treatment did not improve visual function, nor did it prevent apoptosis of RGCs in vitro. We observed a persistent activation of apoptotic signaling pathways in RGCs under FTY720 treatment, a possible underlying mechanism for the lack of neuroprotection in the presence of strong anti-inflammatory effects, Furthermore, FTY720 shifted the remaining inflammation in the optic nerve toward neurotoxicity by modest up-regulation of potential neurotoxic cytokines.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: FTY720 was used for treatment of rats in a model of chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) at an oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on in vivo tracking of macrophages labeled with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles, immunohistological staining (IHC), and neurological readouts was used to study the burden of disease in treated and untreated animals. RESULTS: While untreated animals showed severe paralysis of the hind paws, intense accumulation of macrophages in brain tissue, and areas of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, FTY720-treated animals displayed no signs of inflammatory activity or neurological impairment. These observations were made for both acute phase and first relapse. CONCLUSION: Tracking of macrophages by MRI provides direct evidence of the immunomodulatory efficacy of FTY720 in the EAE model and correlates well with neurological symptoms and histology.",10.1002/jmri.20057,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.20057,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,female,NA,Fingolimod,control,1,37,"0,2",0.2,5,NA,1.8,5,NA,NA,0,5,NA,11,5,NA,NA,T2,NA,Rausch_2004_JMRI,JOUR,1,"Acute Disease and Animals and Blood-Brain Barrier and Brain/metabolism/*pathology and *Contrast Media and Dextrans and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*diagnosis/*drug and therapy/metabolism/pathology and Female and Ferrosoferric Oxide and Fingolimod Hydrochloride and Heterocyclic Compounds and Immunohistochemistry and Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use and *Iron and Macrophages/*pathology and *Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetite Nanoparticles and Organometallic Compounds and *Oxides and Propylene Glycols/*therapeutic use and Rats and Rats, Inbred Lew and Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/agonists and Receptors, Lysophospholipid and Recurrence and Sphingosine",eng,1053-1807 (Print) 1053-1807,16-24,20,15221804,"Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland. martin.rausch@pharma.novartis.com",NA,NA,NA,NA,Jul,NLM,1460,"ASReview_relevant and Rausch, Martin and Hiestand, Peter and Foster, Carolyn A and Baumann, Diana R and Cannet, Catherine and Rudin, Markus and Journal Article and United States and 2004/06/29 and J Magn Reson Imaging. 2004 Jul;20(1):16-24. doi: 10.1002/jmri.20057.",Predictability of FTY720 efficacy in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by in vivo macrophage tracking: clinical implications for ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.09,5,0.1,0.3,15,0.11,NA,gadolinium,NA,0.04,5,0.09,0.2,15,0.03,NA,gadolinium,-0.07,5,0.04,0.14,15,0.03,NA,gadolinium,Marketed,NA,355

In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), B cells are required for spontaneous recovery in acute models. Production of IL-10 by regulatory B cells has been shown to modulate the severity EAE and other autoimmune diseases. Previously, we suggested that B cells regulated the number of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells (Treg) in the CNS during EAE. Because Treg suppress autoimmune responses, we asked whether B cells control autoimmunity by maintenance of Treg numbers. B cell deficiency achieved either genetically (<ce><bc>MT) or by depletion with anti-CD20 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of peripheral but not thymic Treg. Adoptive transfer of WT B cells into <ce><bc>MT mice restored both Treg numbers and recovery from EAE. When we investigated the mechanism whereby B cells induce the proliferation of Treg and EAE recovery, we found that glucocorticoid-induced TNF ligand, but not IL-10, expression by B cells was required. Of clinical significance is the finding that anti-CD20 depletion of B cells accelerated spontaneous EAE and colitis. Our results demonstrate that B cells play a major role in immune tolerance required for the prevention of autoimmunity by maintenance of Treg via their expression of glucocorticoid-induced TNFR ligand.",10.4049/jimmunol.1103354,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1103354,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,B10.PL,NA,NA,Rituximab,control,1,NA,0,1.5,3.5,NA,0.3,45049,NA,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,control=isotype,Ray_2012_JI,JOUR,7,"Adoptive Transfer and Animals and Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/pharmacology and Autoimmunity/*immunology and B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/transplantation and B7 Antigens/immunology and Coculture Techniques and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*immunology and Homeostasis and Interleukin-10/physiology and Lymphocyte Count and Lymphocyte Depletion and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Transgenic and Rituximab and Spleen/immunology and T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/*immunology and Tumor Necrosis Factors/*physiology",eng,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767,3188-98,188,22368274,"Blood Research Institute, BloodCenter of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201-2178, USA.",NA,NA,NA,PMC3311743,45017,NLM,999,"ASReview_relevant and 1550-6606 and Ray, Avijit and Basu, Sreemanti and Williams, Calvin B and Salzman, Nita H and Dittel, Bonnie N and R01 AI069358/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and R01 AI069358-05/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and R01 AI085090/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and R01 GM099526/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2012/03/01 and J Immunol. 2012 Apr 1;188(7):3188-98. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1103354.

Based on the modes of action of interferon-beta (IFN-<ce><b2>) and dimethyl fumarate (DMF), we hypothesized that anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects may synergize in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). METHODS: EAE was induced in C57BL/6 mice by immunization with MOG35-55-peptide. Murine IFN-<ce><b2> was injected s.c. every other day at 10.000IU, and DMF was provided at 15mg/kg by oral gavage twice daily. Control mice received PBS injections and were treated by oral gavage with the vehicle methylcellulose. Mice were scored daily by blinded observers and histological, FACS and cytokine studies were performed to further elucidate the underlying mechanism of action. RESULTS: Combination therapy significantly ameliorated EAE disease course in comparison to controls and monotherapy with IFN-<ce><b2>. Histological analyses showed a significant effect on axon preservation with almost twice as much axons present in inflamed lesions as compared to control. Remarkably, the effect on axonal preservation was more pronounced under combination therapy than with both monotherapies. Neither monotherapy nor combination therapy demonstrated modulation of cytokines and frequency of antigen presenting cells. DISCUSSION: Combination of IFN-<ce><b2> and DMF resulted in greater beneficial effects with improved tissue protection as compared to the respective monotherapies. Further combination studies of these safe therapies in human disease are warranted.",10.1016/j.expneurol.2014.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.expneurol.2014.04.003,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,9,Interferon Beta 1,control,3,NA,1,2.8,24,0.6,5.5,23,0.4,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Reick_2014_ExpNeu,JOUR,NA,"2',3'-Cyclic-Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases/metabolism and Animals and Antigens, Differentiation/metabolism and Axons/*drug effects/pathology and CD3 Complex/metabolism and Cell Proliferation/drug effects and Dimethyl Fumarate and Disease Models, Animal and Drug Synergism and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*complications/*drug therapy and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and Fumarates/*therapeutic use and Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use and Interferon-beta/*therapeutic use and Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein/toxicity and Neurofilament Proteins/metabolism and Peptide Fragments/toxicity and Time Factors and Combination therapy and Eae and Immunomodulation and Interferon-beta and Multiple sclerosis and Neuroprotection",eng,0014-4886,50-6,257,24731948,"Department of Neurology St. Josef-Hospital, Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany; International Graduate School of Neuroscience, Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany.

In our studies, we describe an alternative approach based on targeting CD79b that induces only partial B-cell depletion and achieves therapeutic effects by B-cell modulation. Prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with an antibody against CD79b and also a deglycosylated variant of this antibody, lacking effector function like antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or complement activation, significantly reduced the development and progression of EAE in mice.

The cuprizone (CPZ) model for the CNS de/remyelination has gained a renewed interest during the past decade. CPZ-induced demyelination is considered to be primarily an oligodendrocyte loss with participation of the inflammatory response. As the blood brain barrier remains intact, we found this model advantageous for studying GA effects on CNS remyelination with minimum influence of the peripheral immune cellular component. Our results show that GA, given one week before the CPZ treatment, had a maturational effect functional to remyelination. However, myelin was unorganized as compared to controls. When GA was concomitantly injected with CPZ, oligodendroglial precursor proliferation diminished in favor of maturation and myelin recovered an organized disposition. GA-treated animals also show microglial cell (MG) activation. In vitro assays demonstrated that GA-primed MG cultures had a significant increase in IL-10 and IL-4 secretion. GA-challenged MG-conditioned media induced oligodendrocyte proliferation and subsequent differentiation.

Fingolimod is an effective orally active agent for the treatment of MS, affecting lymphocyte invasion of the brain. However, it is still unclear if fingolimod can be neuroprotective in this disorder. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Using neurophysiological recordings and morphological evaluation of dendritic integrity, we evaluated the effects of oral fingolimod on the clinical score of EAE mice in order to determine whether the compound was associated with preservation of synaptic transmission. KEY RESULTS Oral fingolimod prevented and reversed the pre- and postsynaptic alterations of glutamate transmission in EAE mice. These effects were associated with a clear amelioration of the clinical deterioration seen in EAE mice, and with a significant inhibition of neuronal dendritic pathology. Fingolimod did not alter the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in control animals, suggesting that only the pathological processes behind the inflammation-induced defects in glutamate transmission were modulated by this compound. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The beneficial effects of fingolimod on the clinical, synaptic and dendritic abnormalities of murine EAE might correlate with the neuroprotective actions of this agent, as observed in MS patients.

We hypothesized that antiretroviral therapy alters the maturation of oligodendrocytes which synthesize myelin. We tested whether specific frontline integrase strand transfer inhibitors would alter oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. To model the effect of antiretrovirals on oligodendrocytes, we stimulated primary rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells to differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes in vitro in the presence of therapeutically relevant concentrations of elvitegravir or raltegravir and then assessed differentiation with lineage specific markers. To examine the effect of antiretrovirals on myelination, we treated mice with the demyelinating compound cuprizone, for 5<e2><80><89>weeks. This was followed by 3<e2><80><89>weeks of recovery in absence of cuprizone, during which time some mice received a daily intrajugular injection of elvitegravir. Brains were harvested, sectioned and processed by immunohistochemistry to examine oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination. Elvitegravir inhibited oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner, while raltegravir had no effect. Following cuprizone demyelination, administration of elvitegravir to adult mice reduced remyelination compared with control animals. Elvitegravir treatment activated the integrated stress response in oligodendrocytes in vitro, an effect which was completely blocked by pretreatment with the integrated stress response inhibitor Trans-ISRIB, preventing elvitegravir-mediated inhibition of oligodendrocyte maturation. These studies demonstrate that elvitegravir impairs oligodendrocyte maturation and remyelination and that the integrated stress response mediates this effect and may be a possible therapeutic target.",10.1002/glia.23902,https://doi.org/10.1002/glia.23902,PH,1,NA,cuprizone,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Raltegravir,control,3,44,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,treatment after cuprizone,Roth_2021_Glia,JOUR,2,"Animals and Cell Differentiation and Cuprizone and HIV Infections and Humans and Integrases and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Myelin Sheath and *Oligodendroglia and Quinolones and Raltegravir Potassium and Rats and Hand and Hiv and integrated stress response and myelin and neuroinflammation and oligodendrocytes",eng,0894-1491 (Print) 0894-1491,362-376,69,32894619,"Department of Neurology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.

Although there are potent disease-modifying agents for its initial relapsing-remitting phase, these therapies show limited efficacy in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for the identification of disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic approaches for SPMS. Here, we show that the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator fingolimod (FTY720) ameliorated chronic progressive experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in nonobese diabetic mice, an experimental model that resembles several aspects of SPMS, including neurodegeneration and disease progression driven by the innate immune response in the CNS. Indeed, S1PR modulation by FTY720 in murine and human astrocytes suppressed neurodegeneration-promoting mechanisms mediated by astrocytes, microglia, and CNS-infiltrating proinflammatory monocytes. Genome-wide studies showed that FTY720 suppresses transcriptional programs associated with the promotion of disease progression by astrocytes.

Through genome-wide analyses we detected a transcriptional response to type I interferons (IFN-Is) in astrocytes during experimental CNS autoimmunity and also in CNS lesions from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). IFN-I signaling in astrocytes reduces inflammation and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) disease scores via the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2). The anti-inflammatory effects of nasally administered interferon (IFN)-<ce><b2> are partly mediated by AHR. Dietary tryptophan is metabolized by the gut microbiota into AHR agonists that have an effect on astrocytes to limit CNS inflammation. EAE scores were increased following ampicillin treatment during the recovery phase, and CNS inflammation was reduced in antibiotic-treated mice by supplementation with the tryptophan metabolites indole, indoxyl-3-sulfate, indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-aldehyde, or the bacterial enzyme tryptophanase. In individuals with MS, the circulating levels of AHR agonists were decreased. These findings suggest that IFN-Is produced in the CNS function in combination with metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan by the gut flora to activate AHR signaling in astrocytes and suppress CNS inflammation.",10.1038/nm.4106,https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.4106,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,9,Interferon Beta 1,control,3,NA,"1,2",1.9,10,0.3,3.2,10,0.4,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rothhammer_2016_NatMed,JOUR,6,"Animals and Astrocytes/*immunology and Case-Control Studies and Cell Proliferation and Central Nervous System/immunology/metabolism and Chemokine CCL2/metabolism and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*immunology/metabolism and Fluorescent Antibody Technique and *Gastrointestinal Microbiome and Gene Expression Profiling and Gene Knockdown Techniques and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism and Humans and Immunoblotting and Indican/urine and Indoles/metabolism and Inflammation and Interferon Type I/*immunology and Interferon-beta/pharmacology and Limosilactobacillus reuteri and Mice and Mice, Knockout and Multiple Sclerosis/*immunology/metabolism and Myxovirus Resistance Proteins/metabolism and Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/metabolism and Optical Imaging and Polymerase Chain Reaction and Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta/genetics and Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/*immunology/metabolism and STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism and Serotonin and Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins and T-Lymphocytes/*immunology and Tryptophan/*metabolism and Tryptophanase/metabolism",eng,1078-8956 (Print) 1078-8956,586-97,22,27158906,"Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

H.",1996,J Immunol,The length of treatment determines whether IFN-beta prevents or aggravates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats,"The mechanism of action underlying the beneficial effect of IFN-beta in multiple sclerosis (MS) is not understood. To date, little information is available on the effects of IFN-beta in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal correlate of the human disease MS. Therefore, we investigated the effects of recombinant rat IFN-beta (rrIFN-beta) on EAE in Lewis rats with emphasis on a treatment regimen during the paralytic phase of the disease. The results indicated that rrIFN-beta dose-dependently inhibited disease activity with complete prevention at a s.c. dose of 300,000 U/day, provided that treatment was continued for 3 wk. Discontinuation of treatment on day 17 postimmunization resulted in a protracted and relapsing disease course with strongly enhanced clinical severity. Detailed immunohistology of central nervous system (CNS) tissue of protected animals revealed an almost complete absence of CNS lesions and a >90% reduction in the number of infiltrating leukocytes. Accordingly, isolation of mononuclear cells from spinal cord tissue of successfully treated EAE rats revealed a reduction of approximately 95% in the number of cells that produce IFN-gamma in response to the encephalitogenic peptide MBP63-88. Furthermore, rrIFN-beta significantly enhanced serum corticosterone levels, which showed an inverse relationship with disease activity. We show that rrIFN-beta can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on disease activity dependent on the timing and the duration of treatment. Beneficial effects on EAE are associated with inhibition of the extravasation of blood-derived mononuclear cells in the CNS.",NA,https://doi.org/,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,female,11,Interferon Beta 1,control,3,NA,1,0.1,6,0.1,1.9,6,0.2,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,recombinant rat Interferon Beta 1 was used,Ruuls_1996_JI,JOUR,12,"Animals and Autoantibodies/immunology and Body Weight and Corticosterone/biosynthesis and Dose-Response Relationship, Drug and Drug Administration Schedule and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/pathology/physiopathology/*therapy and Interferon-beta/*administration & dosage and Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis and Lymphoid Tissue/pathology and Myelin Basic Protein/immunology and Rats and Rats, Inbred Lew and Spinal Cord/immunology/pathology and Time Factors",eng,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767,5721-31,157,8955226,"Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.",NA,NA,NA,NA,45275,NLM,1750,"ASReview_relevant and Ruuls, S R and de Labie, M C and Weber, K S and Botman, C A and Groenestein, R J and Dijkstra, C D and Olsson, T and van der Meide, P H and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 1996/12/15 and J Immunol. 1996 Dec 15;157(12):5721-31.",The length of treatment determines whether IFN-beta prevents or aggravates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Marketed,NA,366

We have characterized previously time course and mechanisms of neuronal apoptosis in a rat model of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced optic neuritis. In this animal model, application of IFN-beta-1a three times per week slightly decreases the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the neurons that form the axons within the optic nerve.

In this study, a nanoformulation containing rhMBP with RTX on its surface (Nano-rhMBP-RTX) was prepared and investigated in comparison with other treatment groups to determine its potential neuro-protective effects on C57BL/6 mice after inducing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). METHODS: EAE was induced in the corresponding mice by injecting 100 <ce><bc>L of an emulsion containing complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). The subjects were weighed, scored and subjected to behavioural tests. After reaching a clinical score of 3, various treatments were given to corresponding EAE-induced and non-induced groups including rhMBP, RTX, empty nanoparticle prepared by poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) or the prepared nanoformulation (Nano-rhMBP-RTX). At the end of the study, biochemical parameters were also determined as interferon-<ce><b3> (IFN-<ce><b3>), myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-4 (IL-4), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-<ce><b1>), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), 2', 3' cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase (CNP) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-<ce><b2>) along with some histopathological analyses. RESULTS: The results of the Nano-rhMBP-RTX group showed promising outcomes in terms of reducing the clinical scores, improving the behavioural responses associated with improved histopathological findings.

METHODS: We collected splenocytes and CD4(+) T cells from C57BL/6 wild-type and interferon (IFN)-<ce><b3>-deficient mice. For human PBMCs, venous blood was collected from healthy donors, and PBMCs were collected using the Percoll gradient method. Cells were cultured with anti-CD3/28 in the presence/absence of DF for 3 to 5 days. Cells were stained and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cytokines were measured by ELISA in cell supernatants. For in vivo experiments, EAE was induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein(35-55) and mice were treated with oral DF or vehicle daily. RESULTS: DF acts directly on CD4(+) T cells and suppresses GM-CSF-producing Th1 not Th17 or single GM-CSF(+) T cells in EAE. In addition, GM-CSF suppression depends on the IFN-<ce><b3> pathway. We also show that DF specifically suppresses Th1 and GM-CSF-producing Th1 cells in PBMCs from healthy donors. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that DF exclusively suppresses GM-CSF-producing Th1 cells in both animal and human CD4(+) T cells through an IFN-<ce><b3>-dependent pathway. These findings indicate that DF has a better therapeutic effect on patients with Th1-dominant immunophenotype.

In this study we describe a novel S1P1 agonist AKP-11, next generation of S1P1 agonist, with immunomodulatory activities in cell culture model and for therapeutic efficacy against an animal model of MS, i.e. experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) but without the adverse effects observed with FTY720. Like FTY720, AKP-11 bound to S1P1 is internalized and activates intracellular AKT and ERKs cellular signaling pathways. In contrast to FTY720, AKP-11 mediated S1P1 downregulation is independent of sphingosine kinase activity indicating it to be a direct agonist of S1P1. The S1P1 loss and inhibition of lymphocyte egress by FTY720 leads to lymphopenia. In comparison with FTY720, oral administration of AKP-11 caused milder and reversible lymphopenia while providing a similar degree of therapeutic efficacy in the EAE animal model. Consistent with the observed reversible lymphopenia with AKP-11, the S1P1 recycled back to cell membrane in AKP-11 treated cells following its withdrawal, but not with withdrawal of FTY720. Accordingly, a smaller degree of ubiquitination and proteolysis of S1P1 was observed in AKP-11 treated cells as compared to FTY720. Consistent with previous observations, FTY720 treatment is associated with adverse effects of bradycardia and lung vascular leaks in rodents, whereas AKP-11 treatment had undetectable effects on bradycardia and reduced lung vascular leaks as compared to FTY720. Taken together, the data documents that AKP-11 treatment cause milder and reversible lymphopenia with milder adverse effects while maintaining therapeutic efficacy similar to that observed with FTY720, thus indicating therapeutic potential of AKP-11 for treatment of MS and related autoimmune disorders.",10.1371/journal.pone.0141781,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0141781,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,female,NA,Fingolimod,control,1,NA,2,0.9,6,0.2,2.9,6,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,age=adult,Samuvel_2015_PLoOne,JOUR,10,"Animals and CHO Cells and Capillary Permeability/drug effects and Cell Membrane/metabolism and Cricetulus and Cytokines/metabolism and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/drug therapy/*immunology/*metabolism and Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism and Female and Fingolimod Hydrochloride/administration & dosage/pharmacology and Heart Rate/drug effects and Lymphocyte Count and Multiple Sclerosis/drug therapy/*immunology/*metabolism and Proteolysis and Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism and Rats and Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/*agonists and T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism",eng,1932-6203,e0141781,10,26513477,"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, United States of America.

Adoptive transfer (AT) EAE was induced in groups of six female Lewis rats. Animals were treated with 3 x 10(5) units of recombinant rat IFN-beta s.c. once at 18 hr, or with 10 mg/kg methylprednisolone (MP) i.v. twice at 18 and 6 hr prior to dissection, or with a combination of both. T cell apoptosis was detected by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections of spinal cord, using morphological criteria and TUNEL staining. Double labeling of immune cells was done for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and metalloproteinase (MMP) 2. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was visualized by staining for albumin. In severe EAE, an increase of T cell apoptosis was seen after IFN-beta alone (all data presented as mean +/- SD: 24.5% +/- 2.2%, P < 0.05, vs. 19.4% +/- 3.1% in controls), and in combination with MP (29.4% +/- 7.3%, P < 0.05 vs. controls). Only the combination therapy decreased T cell infiltration (53.9 +/- 17.7 cells/mm(2), P < 0.05, vs. 99.5 +/- 35.2 cells/mm2 in controls). In moderate EAE, the rate of T cell apoptosis was slightly increased after IFN-beta (21.2% +/- 5.2% vs. 17.4% +/- 5.0% in controls), whereas MP alone (25.5% +/- 3.5%, P < 0.01 vs. controls) and the combination therapy (22.4% +/- 4.8%, P < 0.05 vs. controls) had a clear augmenting effect. IFN-beta tended to decrease T cell infiltration (46.1 +/- 12.7 cells/mm2) compared to controls (59.2 +/- 18.5 cells/mm2). The rate of TNF-alpha-expressing T cells was significantly decreased by IFN-beta and in combination with MP. Also, TNF-alpha expression in macrophages was significantly reduced by IFN-beta and by the combination therapy. The rate of MMP2-expressing macrophages was lower after IFN-beta but clearly decreased only in combination with MP. BBB disruption was ameliorated after IFN-beta but significantly only in combination with MP. Our study indicates that IFN-beta affects the immunopathological process in EAE in several ways, but apoptosis appears as a minor component. In view of treatment of MS relapses, the synergistic effects in this study corroborate the use of a combination therapy with high-dose MP and IFN-beta.",10.1002/jnr.1128,https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.1128,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,female,7,Interferon Beta 1,NA,3,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Adoptive Transfer of EAE,Schmidt_2001_JNR,JOUR,1,"Animals and Apoptosis/*immunology and Blood-Brain Barrier/physiology and Cells, Cultured and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy and Female and Immunohistochemistry and Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology and Interferon-beta/*pharmacology and Macrophages/chemistry/cytology/immunology and Methylprednisolone/pharmacology and Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/drug therapy and Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology and Rats and Rats, Inbred Lew and T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*cytology/immunology and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis",eng,0360-4012 (Print) 0360-4012,59-67,65,11433430,"Department of Neurology, Clinical Research Group for Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology, University of WÃ¼rzburg, WÃ¼rzburg, Germany.",NA,NA,NA,NA,45108,NLM,1591,"ASReview_relevant and Schmidt, J and St<c3><bc>rzebecher, S and Toyka, K V and Gold, R and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2001/07/04 and J Neurosci Res. 2001 Jul 1;65(1):59-67. doi: 10.1002/jnr.1128.",Interferon-beta treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis leads to rapid nonapoptotic termination of T cell infiltration,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Marketed,NA,373

The compound is approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Cladribine can cross the blood-brain barrier, suggesting a potential effect on central nervous system (CNS) resident cells. Here, we explored compartment-specific immunosuppressive as well as potential direct neuroprotective effects of oral cladribine treatment in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. METHODS: In the current study, we compare immune cell frequencies and phenotypes in the periphery and CNS of EAE mice with distinct grey and white matter lesions (combined active and focal EAE) either orally treated with cladribine or vehicle, using flow cytometry. To evaluate potential direct neuroprotective effects, we assessed the integrity of the primary auditory cortex neuronal network by studying neuronal activity and spontaneous synaptic activity with electrophysiological techniques ex vivo. RESULTS: Oral cladribine treatment significantly attenuated clinical deficits in EAE mice. Ex vivo flow cytometry showed that cladribine administration led to peripheral immune cell depletion in a compartment-specific manner and reduced immune cell infiltration into the CNS. Histological evaluations revealed no significant differences for inflammatory lesion load following cladribine treatment compared to vehicle control. Single cell electrophysiology in acute brain slices was performed and showed an impact of cladribine treatment on intrinsic cellular firing patterns and spontaneous synaptic transmission in neurons of the primary auditory cortex. Here, cladribine administration in vivo partially restored cortical neuronal network function, reducing action potential firing. Both, the effect on immune cells and neuronal activity were transient. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that cladribine exerts a neuroprotective effect after crossing the blood-brain barrier independently of its peripheral immunosuppressant action.",10.1186/s12974-022-02588-7,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-022-02588-7,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,10,Cladribine,control,1,NA,1,3.5,12,0.5,5.5,12,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Schroeter_2022_JN,JOUR,1,"Mice and Animals and *Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/pathology and Cladribine/therapeutic use and *Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Disease Models, Animal and Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use and *Encephalomyelitis and Cladribine and Cortical grey matter and Electrophysiology and Focal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and Inflammation and Multiple sclerosis and Neuroaxonal damage and Neuroprotection and White matter",eng,1742-2094,270,19,36348455,"Department of Neurology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University DÃ¼sseldorf, MoorenstraÃŸe 5, 40225, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. christinabarbara.schroeter@med.uni-duesseldorf.de.

Despite widespread use of IFN-<ce><b2>, the therapeutic mechanism is still partially understood. Particularly, the clinical relevance of increased B cell activity during IFN-<ce><b2> treatment is unclear. In this article, we show that IFN-<ce><b2> pushes some B cells into a transitional, regulatory population that is a critical mechanism for therapy. IFN-<ce><b2> treatment increases the absolute number of regulatory CD19(+)CD24(++)CD38(++) transitional B cells in peripheral blood relative to treatment-naive and Copaxone-treated patients. In addition, we found that transitional B cells from both healthy controls and IFN-<ce><b2>-treated MS patients are potent producers of IL-10, and that the capability of IFN-<ce><b2> to induce IL-10 is amplified when B cells are stimulated. Similar changes are seen in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. IFN-<ce><b2> treatment increases transitional and regulatory B cell populations, as well as IL-10 secretion in the spleen. Furthermore, we found that IFN-<ce><b2> increases autoantibody production, implicating humoral immune activation in B cell regulatory responses. Finally, we demonstrate that IFN-<ce><b2> therapy requires immune-regulatory B cells by showing that B cell-deficient mice do not benefit clinically or histopathologically from IFN-<ce><b2> treatment.

However, DMF treatment in randomized controlled MS trials was associated with marked reductions in relapse rate and development of active brain MRI lesions, measures considered to reflect CNS inflammation. Here, we investigated the antiinflammatory contribution of Nrf2 in DMF treatment of the MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2-/-) mice were immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide 35-55 (p35-55) for EAE induction and treated with oral DMF or vehicle daily. DMF protected WT and Nrf2-/- mice equally well from development of clinical and histologic EAE. The beneficial effect of DMF treatment in Nrf2-/- and WT mice was accompanied by reduced frequencies of IFN-<ce><b3> and IL-17 producing CD4+ cells and induction of antiinflammatory M2 (type II) monocytes. DMF also modulated B-cell MHC II expression and reduced the incidence of clinical disease in a B-cell dependent model of spontaneous CNS autoimmunity. Our observations that oral DMF treatment promoted immune modulation and provided equal clinical benefit in acute EAE in Nrf2-/- and WT mice, suggest that the antiinflammatory activity of DMF in treatment of MS patients may occur through alternative pathways, independent of Nrf2.",10.1073/pnas.1603907113,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1603907113,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,8.5,Dimethyl fumarate,control,1,NA,1,1.2,5,0.7,3.7,5,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Schulze.Topphoff_2016_ProfthNaAcofScofthUnStofAm,JOUR,17,dimethyl fumarate and gamma interferon and interleukin 17 and major histocompatibility antigen class 2 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein[35-55] and transcription factor Nrf2 and unclassified drug and adaptive immunity and animal cell and animal experiment and animal model and antiinflammatory activity and article and autoimmunity and B lymphocyte and CD4+ T lymphocyte and central nervous system and controlled study and cytokine production and drug efficacy and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and female and immunization and immunomodulation and in vitro study and in vivo study and innate immunity and monocyte and mouse and multiple sclerosis and nonhuman and priority journal and protein expression and wild type,English,1091-6490 0027-8424,4777-4782,113,NA,"S.S.

In the present study, the possibility that glatiramer acetate (GA) treatment influences the MHC class I expression and the synaptic plasticity process in the spinal cord during the course of EAE was investigated. C57BL/6J mice were induced to EAE and submitted to treatment either with a placebo solution or with GA (0.05mg/animal, subcutaneously, on a daily basis). All the animals were sacrificed at the peak disease (14 days after induction) or at the point of recovery of the clinical signs (21 days after induction). The spinal cords were removed and submitted to immunohistochemical examination, Western blotting and transmission electron microscopy analysis. The results showed that GA treat-ment was able to decrease synaptic loss during the course of EAE, which correlates with the downregulation of the MHC I complex. The present results reinforce the neuroprotective role of GA treatment, by reducing synaptic loss during the course of the disease. Such action may be associated with the recently described role of MHC I regulation during the synaptic plasticity process. <c2><a9> Ivyspring International Publisher.",10.7150/ijbs.7.1188,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.7.1188,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,70,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Scorisa_2011_InJoofBiSc,JOUR,8,glatiramer and peptide and autoimmune encephalomyelitis and analysis of variance and animal and article and C57BL mouse and cytology and drug effect and female and gene and gene expression regulation and genetics and immunohistochemistry and mouse and spinal cord and synapse and transmission electron microscopy and ultrastructure and Western blotting,English,1449-2288,1188-1202,7,NA,"A.

Ozanimod profiling revealed a species difference in its potency for S1P(5) in mouse, rat, and canine compared with that for human and monkey. Site-directed mutagenesis identified amino acid alanine at position 120 to be responsible for loss of activity for mouse, rat, and canine S1P(5), and mutation back to threonine as in human/monkey S1P(5) restored activity. Radioligand binding analysis performed with mouse S1P(5) confirmed the potency loss is a consequence of a loss of affinity of ozanimod for mouse S1P(5) and was restored with mutation of alanine 120 to threonine. Study of ozanimod in preclinical mouse models of MS can now determine the S1P receptor(s) responsible for observed efficacies with receptor engagement as measured using pharmacokinetic exposures of free drug. Hence, in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, ozanimod exposures sufficient to engage S1P(1), but not S1P(5), resulted in reduced circulating lymphocytes, disease scores, and body weight loss; reduced inflammation, demyelination, and apoptotic cell counts in the spinal cord; and reduced circulating levels of the neuronal degeneration marker, neurofilament light. In the demyelinating cuprizone model, ozanimod prevented axonal degradation and myelin loss during toxin challenge but did not facilitate enhanced remyelination after intoxication. Since free drug levels in this model only engaged S1P(1,) we concluded that S1P(1) activation is neuroprotective but does not appear to affect remyelination. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Ozanimod, a selective modulator of human sphingisone 1-phosphate receptor subtypes 1 and 5 (S1P(1/5)), displays reduced potency for rodent and dog S1P(5) compared with human, which results from mutation of threonine to alanine at position 120. Ozanimod can thus be used as a selective S1P(1) agonist in mouse models of multiple sclerosis to define efficacies driven by S1P(1) but not S1P(5). Based on readouts for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and cuprizone intoxication, S1P(1) modulation is neuroprotective, but S1P(5) activity may be required for remyelination.",10.1124/jpet.121.000741,https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.121.000741,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,10,Ozanimod,control,1,NA,2,1.1,12,0.2,2.8,12,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"MR mri data was done in cuprizone model, but data not shown",Selkirk_2021_JPET,JOUR,3,"Amino Acid Sequence and Animals and CHO Cells and Cricetinae and Cricetulus and Disease Models, Animal and Dogs and Dose-Response Relationship, Drug and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism and Female and Humans and Indans/*metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use and Male and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Multiple Sclerosis/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism and Oxadiazoles/*metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use and Rats and Species Specificity and Sphingosine 1 Phosphate Receptor Modulators/*metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic and use and Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism",eng,0022-3565,386-399,379,34535564,"Neuroscience Thematic Research Center (J.V.S., K.C.D., Y.G.Y., N.C., S.B., J.M.S., C.L., I.R., R.H.), Non-Clinical Development (D.D.), and Molecular Structure & Design (A.B.), Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, New Jersey Richard.Hargreaves@BMS.com.

It has been shown that green tea epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) might be effective in improving the symptoms and pathological conditions associated with autoimmune inflammatory diseases in several animal models. In this study the effects of EGCG on proteolipid protein (PLP) and oligodendrocyte transcription factor 1 (Olig1) expression in the cerebral cortex of a murine model of cuprizone-induced demyelination was investigated. C57BL/6 mice were treated with cuprizone for six weeks in order to induce demyelination. Immediately after the cessation of cuprizone the animals were divided into 6 groups (n = 10 for each group). The first two groups were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with EGCG in the amount of 50 mg/kg/daily body weight for 2 and 4 weeks. The second two groups (SHAM) were injected IP with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 and 4 weeks, and the third two groups were left without injection as controls. After two and four weeks the mice were killed and the cerebral cortex was collected and the expression of Plp and Olig1 was studied by real-time PCR. The results showed significant increases in PLP and Olig1 expression in the EGCG-treated groups as compared to the SHAM and control groups (p < 0.0001).

Its corresponding animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), is widely used to understand disease pathogenesis and test novel therapeutic agents. However, existing methods to score EAE disease severity are subjective and often vary between individual researchers, making it difficult to translate findings across different studies. An enhanced automated method of disease scoring would eliminate subjectivity and reduce operator-dependent errors. Here, we used an Infra-Red Activity Monitoring System (IRAMS) to measure murine locomotor activity as a surrogate measure of disease severity and compared it to standard EAE scoring methods. In mice immunized with CNS-specific myelin antigens, we observed an inverse correlation between disease severity and mouse activity, with the IRAMS showing enhanced disease scoring compared to standard EAE scoring methods. Relative to standard EAE scoring methods, IRAMS showed comparable measurement of disease relapses and remissions in the SJL/J-relapsing-remitting model of EAE, and could comparably assess the therapeutic efficiency of the MS drug, Copaxone (Glatiramer acetate-GA).

We and others have shown that there is enrichment or depletion of some gut bacteria in MS patients compared to healthy controls (HC), suggesting an important role of the gut bacteria in disease pathogenesis. Thus, specific gut bacteria that are lower in abundance in MS patients could be used as a potential treatment option for this disease. In particular, we and others have shown that MS patients have a lower abundance of Prevotella compared to HC, whereas the abundance of Prevotella is increased in patients that receive disease-modifying therapies such as Copaxone<c2><ae> (Glatiramer acetate-GA). This inverse correlation between the severity of MS disease and the abundance of Prevotella suggests its potential for use as a therapeutic option to treat MS. Notably we have previously identified a specific strain, Prevotella histicola (P. histicola), that suppresses disease in the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) compared with sham treatment. In the present study we analyzed whether the disease suppressing effects of P. histicola synergize with those of the disease-modifying drug Copaxone<c2><ae> to more effectively suppress disease compared to either treatment alone. Treatment with P. histicola was as effective in suppressing disease as treatment with Copaxone<c2><ae>, whereas the combination of P. histicola plus Copaxone<c2><ae> was not more effective than either individual treatment. P. histicola-treated mice had an increased frequency and number of CD4(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells in periphery as well as gut and a decreased frequency of pro-inflammatory IFN-<ce><b3> and IL17-producing CD4 T cells in the CNS, suggesting P. histicola suppresses disease by boosting anti-inflammatory immune responses and inhibiting pro-inflammatory immune responses. In conclusion, our study indicates that the human gut commensal P. histicola can suppress disease as efficiently as Copaxone<c2><ae> and may provide an alternative treatment option for MS patients.",10.3389/fimmu.2019.00462,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00462,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,HLA-DR3.DQ8,both,10,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,NA,"0,1,2",2.4,8,0.3,3.7,8,0.3,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"other data in mean, SD",Shahi_2019_FronImmu,JOUR,NA,"Animals and Brain/drug effects/pathology and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/microbiology/pathology/*therapy and Gastrointestinal Microbiome and Glatiramer Acetate/*therapeutic use and HLA-DR3 Antigen/genetics and Humans and Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use and Mice, Transgenic and Multiple Sclerosis/microbiology/pathology/therapy and *Prevotella and Spinal Cord/drug effects/pathology and Copaxone<c2><ae> and HLA transgenic mice and Prevotella histicola and animal model and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and gut microbiome and immune response and multiple sclerosis",eng,1664-3224,462,10,30984162,"Department of Pathology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States.

Both genetic and environmental factors have been shown to play an important role in MS. Among genetic factors, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II allele such as HLA-DR2, DR3, DR4, DQ6, and DQ8 show the association with the MS. We have previously used transgenic mice expressing MS susceptible HLA class II allele such as HLA-DR2, DR3, DQ6, and DQ8 to validate significance of HLA alleles in MS. Although environmental factors contribute to 2/3 of MS risk, less is known about them. Gut microbiota is emerging as an imporatnt environmental factor in MS pathogenesis. We and others have shown that MS patients have distinct gut microbiota compared to healthy control (HC) with a lower abundance of Prevotella. Additionally, the abundance of Prevotella increased in patients receiving disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) such as Copaxone and/or Interferon-beta (IFN<ce><b2>). We have previously identified a specific strain of Prevotella (Prevotella histicola), which can suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) disease in HLA-DR3.DQ8 transgenic mice. Since Interferon-<ce><b2>-1b [IFN<ce><b2> (Betaseron)] is a major DMTs used in MS patients, we hypothesized that treatment with the combination of P. histicola and IFN<ce><b2> would have an additive effect on the disease suppression. We observed that treatment with P. histicola suppressed disease as effectively as IFN<ce><b2>. Surprisingly, the combination of P. histicola and IFN<ce><b2> was not more effective than either treatment alone. P. histicola alone or in combination with IFN<ce><b2> increased the frequency and number of CD4(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Treatment with P. histicola alone, IFN<ce><b2> alone, and in the combination decreased frequency of pro-inflammatory IFN-<ce><b3> and IL17-producing CD4(+) T cells in the CNS. Additionally, P. histicola alone or IFN<ce><b2> alone or the combination treatments decreased CNS pathology, characterized by reduced microglia and astrocytic activation.

FTY720 also rescues animals from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. The protective effects of FTY720 in EAE are primarily scored manually by examining weight loss and limb paralysis that begins around 10-12 days after immunisation. To our knowledge, pre-clinical effects of FTY720 on animal behaviour early in EAE have not been explored. Here, we developed an automated behaviour monitoring system to examine the early effects of FTY720 on subtle pre-symptomatic behaviour of mice induced with EAE. Our automated home-cage monitoring system (AHC-MS) enabled non-contact detection of movement and ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs) of mice induced with EAE, thus allowing detection of subtle changes in mouse behaviour before paralysis occurs. Mice receiving FTY720 emit longer USVs and display higher levels of motor activity than vehicle-treated EAE mice before clinical symptoms become apparent. Importantly, this study promotes the 3Rs ethics (replacement, reduction and refinement) in the EAE animal model and may also improve pre-screening of potentially novel MS therapies.

Among them is the monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab that depletes mainly B cells and T cells in the immune periphery. Considering the ongoing controversy about the involvement of B cells and in particular the formation of B cell aggregates in the brains of progressive MS patients, an in-depth understanding of the effects of anti-CD52 antibody treatment on the B cell compartment in the CNS itself is desirable. METHODS: We used myelin basic protein (MBP)-proteolipid protein (PLP)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6 (B6) mice as B cell-dependent model of MS. Mice were treated intraperitoneally either at the peak of EAE or at 60<c2><a0>days after onset with 200<c2><a0><ce><bc>g murine anti-CD52 vs. IgG2a isotype control antibody for five consecutive days. Disease was subsequently monitored for 10<c2><a0>days. The antigen-specific B cell/antibody response was measured by ELISPOT<c2><a0>and ELISA. Effects on CNS infiltration and B cell aggregation were determined by immunohistochemistry. Neurodegeneration was evaluated by Luxol Fast Blue, SMI-32, and Olig2/APC staining as well as by electron microscopy and phosphorylated heavy neurofilament serum ELISA. RESULTS: Treatment with anti-CD52 antibody attenuated EAE only when administered at the peak of disease. While there was no effect on the production of MP4-specific IgG, the treatment almost completely depleted CNS infiltrates and B cell aggregates even when given as late as 60<c2><a0>days after onset. On the ultrastructural level, we observed significantly less axonal damage in the spinal cord and cerebellum in chronic EAE after anti-CD52 treatment. CONCLUSION: Anti-CD52 treatment abrogated B cell infiltration and disrupted existing B cell aggregates in the CNS.",10.1186/s12974-018-1263-9,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-018-1263-9,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,6,Alemtuzumab,control,1,41,2,1.5,4,0.5,2.3,5,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Simon_2018_JN,JOUR,1,"Animals and Antibodies/*therapeutic use and Antigen-Presenting Cells/drug effects and Antigens, CD/metabolism and B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*pathology/physiology and CD52 Antigen/*immunology and Central Nervous System/*pathology and Demyelinating Diseases/drug therapy/etiology and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/complications/*drug and therapy/*pathology and Female and Flow Cytometry and Freund's Adjuvant/toxicity and Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Myelin Basic Protein/toxicity and Myelin Proteolipid Protein/toxicity and Neurofilament Proteins/metabolism and Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2/metabolism and Time Factors and Alemtuzumab and B cells and Cd52 and Cns and Eae and Ms",eng,1742-2094,225,15,30098594,"Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of WÃ¼rzburg, WÃ¼rzburg, Germany.

Strategies to increase the level of these trophic molecules may facilitate repair in demyelinating conditions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Because leukocytes are a source of neurotrophic factors, and as glatiramer acetate (GA) generates T helper 2 (Th2) lymphocytes that are not known to be harmful, we tested the hypothesis that GA regulates oligodendrogenesis and myelin formation. First, we generated GA-reactive Th2 cells and determined that they produced transcripts for neurotrophic factors, including insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). The conditioned medium from GA-reactive T cells elevated IGF-1 protein and promoted the formation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) from embryonic brain-derived forebrain cells in culture. We next subjected mice to lysolecithin-induced demyelination of the spinal cord. At 7 days after the insult, the number of OPCs in the demyelinated dorsal column was higher than that in uninjured controls, and was further increased by the daily s.c. injection with GA. Increased OPC generation by GA was associated temporally with the elevation of IGF-1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the spinal cord.

W.",2011,J Neuroinflammation,Predominance of Th2 polarization by vitamin D through a STAT6-dependent mechanism,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D has several reported immunomodulatory properties including the reduced generation of pro-inflammatory CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) cells and the increase in levels of the anti-inflammatory Th2 subset. Less clear has been the impact of vitamin D on the pro-inflammatory Th17 subset, and whether and how vitamin D may preferentially drive the polarization of one of the T helper subsets. METHODS: Using human peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells and mouse splenocytes and lymph node cells in culture, we examined whether and how vitamin D preferentially skews T cells towards the Th1, Th2 or Th17 subsets. Mice afflicted with the multiple sclerosis-like condition, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), were examined in vivo for the relevance of the tissue culture-derived results. RESULTS: We report that the biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 {1,25(OH)2D3}, consistently generates human and murine Th2 cells in culture, frequently leaving unchanged the levels of Th1/Th17 cytokines. As a result, the ratio of Th2 to Th1 and Th17 is increased by 1,25(OH)2D3. The upregulation of Th2 to Th1 or Th17 subsets by 1,25(OH)2D3 is enabled by an increase of the GATA-3 transcription factor, which itself is promoted upstream by an elevation of the STAT6 transcription factor. In mice, the alleviation of EAE severity by 1,25(OH)2D3 is accompanied by elevation of levels of GATA-3 and STAT6. Significantly, the efficacy of 1,25(OH)2D3 in ameliorating EAE is completely lost in mice genetically deficient for STAT6, which was accompanied by the inability of 1,25(OH)2D3 to raise GATA-3 in STAT6 null lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These results of vitamin D promoting a Th2 shift through upstream GATA-3 and STAT6 transcription factors shed mechanistic understanding on the utility of vitamin D in MS.",10.1186/1742-2094-8-56,https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-8-56,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,8.5,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,1,0,5,0,7,5,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Sloka_2011_JN,JOUR,NA,"Animals and Cells, Cultured and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/drug therapy/immunology and Female and GATA3 Transcription Factor/metabolism and Glycoproteins/immunology and Humans and Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/immunology and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Knockout and Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein and Peptide Fragments/immunology and Receptor, Notch1/metabolism and STAT6 Transcription Factor/genetics/*immunology and Spleen/cytology and Th1 Cells/cytology/immunology and Th17 Cells/cytology/immunology and Th2 Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*immunology and Vitamin D/*pharmacology/therapeutic use",eng,1742-2094,56,8,21605467,"Hotchkiss Brain Institute and the Department of Clinical Neurosciences University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.",NA,NA,NA,PMC3118349,45070,NLM,1059,"ASReview_relevant and 1742-2094 and Sloka, Scott and Silva, Claudia and Wang, Jianxiong and Yong, V Wee and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and England and 2011/05/25 and J Neuroinflammation. 2011 May 24;8:56. doi: 10.1186/1742-2094-8-56.",Predominance of Th2 polarization by vitamin D through a STAT6-dependent mechanism,NA,NA,20110524,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,388

As MS is an inflammatory disorder with degeneration of axons and neurons, we examined whether the biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3), could protect against the T cell-mediated killing of human neurons in culture, and the axonal loss seen in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Human neurons were exposed to activated human T lymphocytes and the loss of neurons was documented 24 hours later by counting the number of microtubule-associated protein-2 positive cells. Mice with EAE were harvested for counts of axonal profiles in the spinal cord. 1,25D3 was exposed to T cells in culture or administered to mice from peak EAE clinical severity when axonal loss was already evolving. Activated T lymphocytes killed human neurons prominently within 24 hours but toxicity was significantly attenuated when T cells were exposed to 1,25D3 prior to the co-culture. In EAE, 1,25D3 treatment initiated from peak clinical severity reduced the extent of clinical disability and mitigated the progressive loss of axons. The reduction of axonal and neuronal loss by 1,25D3 in the context of an inflammatory assault to the central nervous system is a potential contributor to the putative benefits of vitamin D in MS.",10.1371/journal.pone.0144084,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144084,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,8.5,Vitamin D3,control,1,36,2,4.3,16,0.8,7.5,16,0.5,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Sloka_2015_PLoOne,JOUR,12,"Animals and Calcitriol/*pharmacology and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/immunology/*prevention & control and Mice and Neurons/cytology/*drug effects/immunology",eng,1932-6203,e0144084,10,26679341,"Hotchkiss Brain Institute and the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.",NA,NA,Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,PMC4683031,NA,NLM,645,"ASReview_relevant and 1932-6203 and Sloka, Scott and Zhornitsky, Simon and Silva, Claudia and Metz, Luanne M and Yong, V Wee and Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2015/12/19 and PLoS One. 2015 Dec 17;10(12):e0144084. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0144084. eCollection 2015.","1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Protects against Immune-Mediated Killing of Neurons in Culture and in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis",NA,NA,20151217,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,389

Here, we evaluated the potential of an agonist at this receptor, FTY720 (fingolimod), to activate the promyelinating pathways within the brain to encourage remyelination and neuroprotection. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In this study, we used the cuprizone model in male C57BL/6 mice and tested the promyelinating and neuroprotective effects of FTY720 after acute and chronic toxin-induced experimental demyelination. We used histological, immunohistochemical and gene expression methods. KEY RESULTS: The midline of the corpus callosum was severely demyelinated after acute and chronic cuprizone-induced demyelination. Robust endogenous remyelination was evident after acute, but impaired after chronic, demyelination. FTY720 treatment modestly accelerated myelin recovery after acute but not chronic cuprizone exposure. Markers of gliosis (astrocyte and microglia activation) were not affected by FTY720 treatment. Remarkably, the accumulation of amyloid precursor protein-positive spheroids in axons was less distinct in FTY720-treated animals, indicating that this compound alleviated ongoing axonal damage. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We show that even during endogenous remyelination, axonal degeneration continued at a low level, accumulating over time. This continuous neurodegenerative process was ameliorated by FTY720 treatment. FTY720 preserved CNS integrity by direct interaction with brain resident cells, the actions of which are still to be defined.",10.1111/bph.12938,https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.12938,PH,1,NA,cuprizone,mouse,C57BL/6,male,8,Fingolimod,control,3,72,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,treatment during recovery after curprizone diet was ended,Slowik_2015_BJP,JOUR,1,"Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor/metabolism and Animals and Corpus Callosum/drug effects/pathology and Cuprizone and Demyelinating Diseases/chemically induced/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism and Fingolimod Hydrochloride and Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects and Liver/drug effects/metabolism and Male and Membrane Proteins/genetics and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Phosphatidate Phosphatase/genetics and Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics and Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics and Propylene Glycols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/*agonists and Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use",eng,0007-1188 (Print) 0007-1188,80-92,172,25220526,"Institute of Neuroanatomy, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.",NA,NA,NA,PMC4280969,Jan,NLM,783,"ASReview_relevant and 1476-5381 and Slowik, A and Schmidt, T and Beyer, C and Amor, S and Clarner, T and Kipp, M and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and England and 2014/09/16 and Br J Pharmacol. 2015 Jan;172(1):80-92. doi: 10.1111/bph.12938.

R.",2000,Brain,"Effects of 4-aminopyridine on demyelinated axons, synapses and muscle tension","Several clinical trials have demonstrated that 4-amino-pyridine (4-AP), a potassium channel-blocking agent, improves symptoms in some patients with multiple sclerosis. The beneficial effects have typically been attributed to the restoration of conduction to demyelinated axons, since this effect was previously demonstrated experimentally. However, the clinical dose is approximately 250-1000 times lower than that used experimentally, potentially making extrapolation of the experimental findings unreliable. To examine the action(s) of 4-AP in demyelinating disorders, the drug was administered at clinical doses, both in vivo and in vitro, to rat dorsal column axons which had been experimentally demyelinated by the intraspinal injection of ethidium bromide. 4-AP had no consistent effect in restoring conduction to demyelinated axons, even to axons which were held just on the verge of conducting by adjusting the lesion temperature. However, 4-AP had prominent effects that did not involve demyelinated axons, including the potentiation of synaptic transmission and an increase in skeletal muscle twitch tension. We propose that these latter effects may be largely responsible for the beneficial action of 4-AP in multiple sclerosis patients. If so, the dominant effects of 4-AP in multiple sclerosis patients are independent of demyelination, and it follows that 4-AP may be beneficial in other neurological disorders in which function is diminished.",10.1093/brain/123.1.171,https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/123.1.171,PH,1,NA,ethidium bromide,rat,"Sprague-Dawley, Wistar",male,NA,Fampridine,control,3,21,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,age=adult,Smith_2000_Brai,JOUR,NA,"4-Aminopyridine/*pharmacology and Animals and Axons/drug effects/*physiology and Demyelinating Diseases/physiopathology and Male and Muscle Contraction/*drug effects and Muscle, Skeletal/drug effects/*physiology and Myelin Sheath/*physiology and Nerve Fibers, Myelinated/drug effects/physiology and Neural Conduction/*drug effects/physiology and Rats and Rats, Sprague-Dawley and Rats, Wistar and Synapses/drug effects/*physiology and Synaptic Transmission/*drug effects",eng,0006-8950 (Print) 0006-8950,171-84,123 ( Pt 1),10611131,"Neuroinflammation Research Group, Department of Neuroimmunology, Guy's, King's and St Thomas' School of Medicine, Guy's Campus, London SE1 9RT, UK. kenneth.smith@kcl.ac.uk",NA,NA,NA,NA,Jan,NLM,1651,"ASReview_relevant and Smith, K J and Felts, P A and John, G R and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and England and 1999/12/28 and Brain. 2000 Jan;123 ( Pt 1):171-84. doi: 10.1093/brain/123.1.171.","Effects of 4-aminopyridine on demyelinated axons, synapses and muscle tension",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Marketed,NA,391

Cytokines belong to Th1 or Th2 family and inflammatory cells, play significant role in pathophysiology of MS. Thus, any treatment supposed to influence the relation between Th1 to Th2 cytokines expression. Although vitamin D has been prescribed as a therapeutic supplement of MS for a long time, it is not clear how much it may affect the Th1/Th2 ratio. To answer this question the present research was designed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty C57BL/6 adult female mice were used. The animals were randomly divided into trial and control groups. Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) modeling for MS and clinical scoring as cited by others was used. Based on scoring and step of the disease vitamin D3 prescription (5 mg/kg) started and continued for three weeks. RESULTS: By using ELISA and RT-PCR the brain level of TNF-<ce><b1>, IL-10, IL-4 and IL-12 determined. Significant decrease of clinical symptoms in trial group which received vitamin D was seen comparing to control animals (P<0.05). The level of TNF-<ce><b1> but not IL-10 significantly decreased following vitamin D3 administration. By comparing the level of Th1 and Th2 Interleukins and counting the ratio of them we found that in treated animals the ratio was significantly less than non-treated (P=0.01). CONCLUSION: According to the results, vitamin D3 may be able to suppress the inflammatory ways that lead to progression of MS. Whether this ability is clinically valuable in human subjects is not clear and needs more clinical research.",NA,https://doi.org/,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,11,Vitamin D3,control,1,30,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Soleimani_2014_IJBMS,JOUR,10,Eae and Th1/Th2 ratio and Vitamin D3,eng,2008-3866 (Print) 2008-3866,785-92,17,25729548,"Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran ; Department of Medical Basic Sciences, University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

P.",2013,J Neuroimmunol,Complexity of trophic factor signaling in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis: differential expression of neurotrophic and gliotrophic factors,"Soluble factors that promote survival and differentiation of glia and neurons during development are likely to play key roles in neurodegeneration and demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and have the potential to be important therapeutic targets. We examined the effect of TrkB signaling and the expression patterns of neurotrophic and gliotrophic factors in the mouse brain in MOG-induced experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). With induction of mild disease, TrkB heterozygous mice were more severely affected compared to their wild type littermates. However, with more potent disease induction, TrkB heterozygotes fared similar to their wild type littermates, suggesting complex modulatory roles for TrkB signaling. One possible explanation for this difference is that the expression patterns of neurotrophic factors correlate with disease severity in individual mice with mild disease, but not in more severe disease. With the less potent induction in C57BL/6 mice, we found that BDNF was consistently increased at EAE onset, while the soluble gliotrophic factor neuregulin (NRG1) was increased only in the chronic phase of the disease. Treatment of these animals with glatiramer acetate (GA) to decrease disease severity resulted in lower levels of both BDNF and NRG1 expression in some mice at 35days after immunization compared to those in untreated EAE mice, but had no direct effect on these factors in the absence of EAE. Our results suggest a complex interplay between neurotrophic and gliotrophic factors in EAE that is dependent on disease stage and severity. While signaling by BDNF through TrkB is protective in mild disease, this effect was not seen in more severe disease. The late induction of NRG1 in the chronic stage of disease could also worsen disease severity through its known ability to activate microglial, inflammatory pathways. While complex, these studies begin to define underlying axoglial trophic activities that are likely involved in both disease pathogenesis and repair.",10.1016/j.jneuroim.2013.05.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2013.05.012,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,NA,Glatiramer acetate,control,3,NA,"1,2",0.25,4,NA,2.9,4,NA,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Song_2013_JN,JOUR,44958,"Animals and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics and Chronic Disease and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/chemically induced/drug and therapy/*metabolism and Female and Genetic Carrier Screening and Glatiramer Acetate and Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Transgenic and Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein/physiology and Neuregulin-1/*biosynthesis/genetics and Peptides/physiology and Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics and Receptor, trkB/*biosynthesis/genetics and Severity of Illness Index and Signal Transduction/drug effects/*genetics and BDNF and TrkB tyrosine kinase receptor and Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and Multiple sclerosis and Neuregulin1",eng,0165-5728 (Print) 0165-5728,45149,262,23763772,"Department of Neurology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201, United States; The Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201, United States; Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201, United States.

K-PLP was designed to mimic the cationic nature of the relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis treatment, glatiramer acetate (GA). With a pI of ~10, GA is able to form visible aggregates at the site of injection via electrostatic interactions with the anionic extracellular matrix. Aggregation further facilitates the retention of GA at the site of injection and draining lymph nodes, which may contribute to its mechanism of action. K-PLP with a pI of ~11, was found to form visible aggregates in the presence of glycosaminoglycans and persist at the injection site and draining lymph nodes in vivo, similar to GA. Additionally, EAE mice treated with K-PLP showed significant inhibition of clinical symptoms compared to free poly-lysine and to PLP, which are the components of K-PLP. The ability of the poly-lysine motif to retain PLP at the injection site, which increased the local exposure of PLP to immune cells may be an important factor affecting drug efficacy.",10.3389/fimmu.2020.603029,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.603029,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SJL,female,5,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,NA,1,2.4,6,1.4,1,6,0.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Song_2020_FronImmu,JOUR,NA,"Animals and Autoantigens/*administration & dosage/chemistry/metabolism and Cells, Cultured and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism and Female and Glatiramer Acetate/*administration & dosage/metabolism and Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/metabolism and Injections, Subcutaneous and Lymph Nodes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism and Mice and *Molecular Mimicry and Peptides/*administration & dosage/chemical synthesis/metabolism and Protein Aggregates and Spleen/drug effects/immunology/metabolism and Tissue Distribution and Copaxone<c2><ae> and Eae and SC injection simulation and glatiramer acetate and multiple sclerosis and poly-lysine",eng,1664-3224,603029,11,33537031,"Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, United States.

Whereas IFN-alpha and -beta induced IFN-gamma secretion, a Th1 cytokine, IFN-tau did not. Oral IFN-tau alone suppressed EAE. When suboptimal doses were administered orally in combination to wild-type mice, IFN-tau and glatiramer acetate had a synergistic beneficial effect in suppression of EAE.

E.",2005,J Immunol,Vitamin D3 confers protection from autoimmune encephalomyelitis only in female mice,"The prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) increases significantly with decreasing UV B light exposure, possibly reflecting a protective effect of vitamin D(3). Consistent with this theory, previous research has shown a strong protective effect 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an MS model. However, it is not known whether the hormone precursor, vitamin D(3), has protective effects in EAE. To address this question, B10.PL mice were fed a diet with or without vitamin D(3), immunized with myelin basic protein, and studied for signs of EAE and for metabolites and transcripts of the vitamin D(3) endocrine system. The intact, vitamin D(3)-fed female mice had significantly less clinical, histopathological, and immunological signs of EAE than ovariectomized females or intact or castrated males. Correlating with reduced EAE, the intact, vitamin D(3)-fed female mice had significantly more 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and fewer CYP24A1 transcripts, encoding the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)-inactivating enzyme, in the spinal cord than the other groups of mice. Thus, there was an unexpected synergy between vitamin D(3) and ovarian tissue with regard to EAE inhibition. We hypothesize that an ovarian hormone inhibited CYP24A1 gene expression in the spinal cord, so the locally-produced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) accumulated and resolved the inflammation before severe EAE developed. If humans have a similar gender difference in vitamin D(3) metabolism in the CNS, then sunlight deprivation would increase the MS risk more significantly in women than in men, which may contribute to the unexplained higher MS incidence in women than in men.",10.4049/jimmunol.175.6.4119,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.175.6.4119,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,B10.PL,both,8,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,0,1.05,53,NA,1.65,53,NA,mean,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Spach_2005_JI,JOUR,6,"Animals and Cholecalciferol/*pharmacology/therapeutic use and Dietary Supplements and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/*etiology/prevention & and control and Female and Male and Mice and Multiple Sclerosis/etiology and Myelin Basic Protein/administration & dosage and Ovariectomy and RNA, Messenger/analysis and Sex Factors and Spinal Cord/chemistry and Steroid Hydroxylases/genetics and Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase",eng,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767,4119-26,175,16148162,"Department of Nutritional Sciences, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,45184,NLM,1411,"ASReview_relevant and Spach, Karen M and Hayes, Colleen E and DK 07665-08/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and United States and 2005/09/09 and J Immunol. 2005 Sep 15;175(6):4119-26. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.175.6.4119.",Vitamin D3 confers protection from autoimmune encephalomyelitis only in female mice,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,398

E.",2006,J Immunol,"IL-10 signaling is essential for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-mediated inhibition of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","Multiple sclerosis (MS) results from an aberrant, neuroantigen-specific, T cell-mediated autoimmune response. Because MS prevalence and severity decrease sharply with increasing sunlight exposure, and sunlight supports vitamin D(3) synthesis, we proposed that vitamin D(3) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)) may protect against MS. In support of this hypothesis, 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) strongly inhibited experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). This inhibition required lymphocytes other than the encephalitogenic T cells. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) might inhibit EAE through the action of IL-10-producing regulatory lymphocytes. We report that vitamin D(3) and 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) strongly inhibited myelin oligodendrocyte peptide (MOG(35-55))-induced EAE in C57BL/6 mice, but completely failed to inhibit EAE in mice with a disrupted IL-10 or IL-10R gene. Thus, a functional IL-10-IL-10R pathway was essential for 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) to inhibit EAE. The 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) also failed to inhibit EAE in reciprocal, mixed bone marrow chimeras constructed by transferring IL-10-deficient bone marrow into irradiated wild-type mice and vice versa. Thus, 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) may be enhancing an anti-inflammatory loop involving hemopoietic cell-produced IL-10 acting on brain parenchymal cells and vice versa. If this interpretation is correct, and humans have a similar bidirectional IL-10-dependent loop, then an IL-10-IL-10R pathway defect could abrogate the anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective functions of sunlight and vitamin D(3). In this way, a genetic IL-10-IL-10R pathway defect could interact with an environmental risk factor, vitamin D(3) insufficiency, to increase MS risk and severity.",10.4049/jimmunol.177.9.6030,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.177.9.6030,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,both,7,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,"0,2",0.5,22,NA,2.8,22,NA,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Spach_2006_JI,JOUR,9,"Animals and Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/immunology and Calcitriol/*administration & dosage and Chimera/immunology and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/immunology/pathology/*prevention & and control and Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors and Interleukin-10/genetics/*metabolism and Mice and Mice, Mutant Strains and Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein and Peptide Fragments/antagonists & inhibitors and Receptors, Interleukin-10/genetics/*metabolism and Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology and T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology",eng,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767,1508635,177,17056528,"Department of Nutritional Sciences, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Wisconsin, 433 Babcock Drive, Madison, WI 53706, USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,45231,NLM,1366,"ASReview_relevant and Spach, Karen M and Nashold, Faye E and Dittel, Bonnie N and Hayes, Colleen E and DK 07665-08/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2006/10/24 and J Immunol. 2006 Nov 1;177(9):6030-7. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.177.9.6030.","IL-10 signaling is essential for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-mediated inhibition of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,399

Epidemiological, genetic, and biological evidence suggests that insufficient vitamin D may be an MS risk factor. However, little is known about how vitamin D might be protective in MS. We hypothesized that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] might regulate gene expression patterns in a manner that would resolve inflammation. To test this hypothesis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in mice, 1,25-(OH)2D3 or a placebo was administered, and 6 h later, DNA microarray hybridization was performed with spinal cord RNA to analyze the gene expression patterns. At this time, clinical, histopathological, and biological studies showed that the two groups did not differ in EAE disease, but changes in several 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive genes indicated that the 1,25-(OH)2D3 had reached the CNS. Compared with normal mice, placebo-treated mice with EAE showed increased expression of many immune system genes, confirming the acute inflammation. When 1,25-(OH)2D3 was administered, several genes like glial fibrillary acidic protein and eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha kinase 4, whose expression increased or decreased with EAE, returned to homeostatic levels.

E.",2015,J Neuroimmunol,Vitamin D and estrogen synergy in Vdr-expressing CD4(+) T cells is essential to induce Helios(+)FoxP3(+) T cells and prevent autoimmune demyelinating disease,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from an autoimmune attack on the axon-myelin unit. A female MS bias becomes evident after puberty and female incidence has tripled in the last half-century, implicating a female sex hormone interacting with a modifiable environmental factor. These aspects of MS suggest that many female MS cases may be preventable. Mechanistic knowledge of this hormone-environment interaction is needed to devise strategies to reduce female MS risk. We previously demonstrated that vitamin D3 (D3) deficiency increases and D3 supplementation decreases experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) risk in a female-biased manner. We also showed that D3 acts in an estrogen (E2)-dependent manner, since ovariectomy eliminated and E2 restored D3-mediated EAE protection. Here we probed the hypothesis that E2 and D3 interact synergistically within CD4(+) T cells to control T cell fate and prevent demyelinating disease. The E2 increased EAE resistance in wild-type (WT) but not T-Vdr(0) mice lacking Vdr gene function in CD4(+) T cells, so E2 action depended entirely on Vdr(+)CD4(+) T cells. The E2 levels were higher in WT than T-Vdr(0) mice, suggesting the Vdr(+)CD4(+) T cells produced E2 or stimulated its production. The E2 decreased Cyp24a1 and increased Vdr transcripts in T cells, prolonging the calcitriol half-life and increasing calcitriol responsiveness. The E2 also increased CD4(+)Helios(+)FoxP3(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells in a Vdr-dependent manner. Thus, CD4(+) T cells have a cooperative amplification loop involving E2 and calcitriol that promotes CD4(+)Helios(+)FoxP3(+) Treg cell development and is disrupted when the D3 pathway is impaired. The global decline in population D3 status may be undermining a similar cooperative E2-D3 interaction controlling Treg cell differentiation in women, causing a breakdown in T cell self tolerance and a rise in MS incidence.",10.1016/j.jneuroim.2015.06.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2015.06.015,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,both,7,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,0,1.4,11.5,0.3,3.2,11.5,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Spanier_2015_JN,JOUR,NA,"Animals and Autoimmune Diseases of the Nervous System/chemically and induced/genetics/pathology/*prevention & control and CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism and DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism and Disease Models, Animal and Drug Synergism and Estrogens/*administration & dosage and Female and Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism and Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects/genetics and In Vitro Techniques and Male and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Transgenic and Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein/toxicity and Ovariectomy and Peptide Fragments/toxicity and Pregnancy and Receptors, Calcitriol/genetics/*metabolism and T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/*metabolism and Time Factors and Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism and Uterus/pathology and Vitamin D/*administration & dosage and Estrogen and Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and HeliosFoxP3 T cells and Multiple sclerosis and Prevention and Vitamin D",eng,0165-5728,48-58,286,26298324,"Department of Medicine, Center for Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.

To test this hypothesis, we targeted the Cyp27b1 gene specifically in myeloid cells, then analyzed the influence of disrupted myeloid cell 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) synthesis on vitamin D(3)-mediated resistance to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Myeloid cell 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) synthesis was essential for vitamin D(3)-mediated EAE resistance. Increased CTLA-4 expression in the CNS-infiltrating CD4(+) Tconv and Treg cells and decreased splenic B cell CD86 expression correlated with resistance.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) research firmly supports this hypothesis. Vitamin D3 supports 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-[OH]2D 3) synthesis in the CNS, initiating biological processes that reduce pathogenic CD4+ T cell longevity. MS is prevalent in Sardinia despite high ambient UV irradiation, challenging the vitamin D-MS hypothesis. Sardinian MS patients frequently carry a low Ifng expresser allele, suggesting that inadequate IFN-<ce><b3> may undermine vitamin D3-mediated inhibition of demyelinating disease. Testing this hypothesis, we found vitamin D3 failed to inhibit EAE in female Ifng knockout (GKO) mice, unlike wild-type mice. The two strains did not differ in Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1 gene expression, implying equivalent vitamin D3 metabolism in the CNS. The 1,25-(OH) 2D3 inhibited EAE in both strains, but 2-fold more 1,25-(OH)2D3 was needed in GKO mice, causing hypercalcemic toxicity. Unexpectedly, GKO mice had very low Vdr gene expression in the CNS. Injecting IFN-<ce><b3> intracranially into adult mice did not increase Vdr gene expression. Correlating with low Vdr expression, GKO mice had more numerous pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells in the CNS, and 1,25-(OH)2D3 reduced these cells in GKO and wild-type mice without altering Foxp3 + regulatory T cells. Thus, the Ifng gene was needed for CNS Vdr gene expression and vitamin D3-dependent mechanisms that inhibit EAE. Individuals with inadequate Ifng expression may have increased MS risk despite high ambient UV irradiation because of low Vdr gene expression and a high encephalitogenic T cell burden in the CNS.

Orally administered cholesterol-lowering HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (known as statins), which exhibit immunomodulatory properties and are effective in treatment of the MS model EAE, are being tested in MS. As atorvastatin can enhance protective Th2 responses and has a different mechanism of action than glatiramer acetate (GA), a parenterally administered immunomodulatory agent approved for MS treatment, we tested whether the combination of these agents could be beneficial in EAE. Combination therapy using suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and GA prevented or reversed clinical and histologic EAE. Secretion of proinflammatory Th1 cytokines was reduced--and conversely Th2 cytokine secretion was increased--in these mice, but not in mice treated with each drug alone at the same doses.

In rats of both sexes, DMF administration from the day of immunization attenuated EAE severity, but this effect was more prominent in males leading to loss of the sexual dimorphism observed in vehicle-administered controls. Consistently, in male rats, DMF was more efficient in diminishing the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes infiltrating spinal cord (SC) and their reactivation, the number of IL-17+ T lymphocytes and particularly cellularity of their highly pathogenic IFN-<ce><b3>+GM-CSF+IL-17+ subset.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected 14 days after EAE induction at the peak of neurological symptoms, and proteomics analysis was performed using nano-LC-Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Additionally, the minocycline concentration in CSF was determined using quantitative matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS) in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. Fifty percent of the minocycline-treated EAE animals did not show neurological symptoms on day 14 (""responders""), while the other half displayed neurological symptoms (""nonresponders""), indicating that minocycline delayed disease onset and attenuated disease severity in some, but not all, animals. Neither CSF nor plasma minocycline concentrations correlated with the onset of symptoms or disease severity. Analysis of the proteomics data resulted in a list of 20 differentially abundant proteins between the untreated animals and the responder group of animals. Two of these proteins, complement C3 and carboxypeptidase B2, were validated by quantitative LC-MS/MS in the SRM mode. Differences in the CSF proteome between untreated EAE animals and minocycline-treated responders were similar to the differences between minocycline-treated responders and nonresponders (70% overlap). Six proteins that remained unchanged in the minocycline-treated animals but were elevated in untreated EAE animals may be related to the mechanism of action of minocycline. <c2><a9> 2012 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/pr300428e,https://doi.org/10.1021/pr300428e,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,male,NA,Minocycline,control,3,60,1,0.5,15,0.9,2.3,15,0.9,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Stoop_2012_JoofPrRe,JOUR,8,carboxypeptidase and complement component C3 and minocycline and proteome and autoimmune encephalomyelitis and animal experiment and animal model and article and cerebrospinal fluid and cerebrospinal fluid analysis and controlled study and disease severity and male and mass spectrometry and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry and nonhuman and priority journal and protein analysis and quantitative analysis and rat and tandem mass spectrometry and treatment response,English,1535-3893 1535-3907,4315-4325,11,NA,"R.

Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that sIFNAR2 shows intrinsic properties by modulating the CP-EAE progression and the neuroinflammation processes related to this disease.

We previously established the protective effects of 17<ce><b2>-estradiol (E2) on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In the current study we investigated the effectiveness of oral treatment with ethinyl estradiol (EE) on EAE and the mechanisms involved. Ethinyl estradiol is a semisynthetic estrogen compound found in birth control pills, and its chemical structure allows this compound to retain activity when given orally. We found that oral EE, like E2, drastically suppressed EAE induced by proteolipid protein 139-151 peptide when given at initiation of EAE. However, unlike E2, EE reduced clinical severity when given after the onset of clinical signs. Treatment with EE significantly decreased the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-<ce><b3>, TNF-<ce><b1>, and IL-6) by activated T cells as well as the expression of a key matrix metalloproteinase, disease-mediating chemokines/receptors, and IgG2a levels, but increased the expression of TGF-<ce><b2>3 in the CNS. The absence of infiltrating lymphocytes together with the suppression of cytokines, matrix metalloproteinase, and chemokines/receptors suggests that EE, like E2, protects mice from EAE by inhibiting the recruitment of T cells and macrophages into the CNS.

Our results demonstrated that vitamin D3-mediated prevention of clinical signs, CNS cellular lesions and demyelination observed in WT mice was abrogated in GPR30-KO mice with EAE. Regulatory effects of vitamin D3 treatment that were MER dependent included increased levels of IL-10 and IL-6 secreted by MOG peptide-reactive splenocytes and increased expression of CCL5, CCR1 & CCR3 in spleen tissue.

Due to the complex pathogenesis of MS, drugs to treat MS often show partial effectiveness. Earlier experiments have demonstrated that both atorvastatin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) may ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is known as a classical model of MS, via different protective mechanisms. Since combination therapy can exhibit more beneficial effects than monotherapy, we observed the protective effects of combined treatment of atorvastatin and NAD+ in EAE mice. Our results showed that the combined treatment of these two drugs at half of their optimal dosages had synergistic effect to alleviate the severity of EAE in mice than treatment with each alone. The combined treatment of EAE mice with atorvastatin plus NAD+ relieved the clinical signs and histologic changes, increased the proportion of Treg cells, attenuated IL-17 production, reduced proinflammatory cytokine secretion of Th17 cells, and increased cytokine secretion of Treg cells. In addition, the combined treatment also diminished phosphorylation of both P38 MAPK and ERK, while elevated SIRT1 expression.

However, whether myelin impairment could cause AD-like neurological pathology remains unclear. To explore neurological pathology following myelin injury, we assessed cognitive function, the expression of myelin proteins, axonal transport-associated proteins, axonal structural proteins, synapse-associated proteins, tau and beta amyloid and the status of neurons, using the cuprizone mouse model of demyelination. We found the mild impairment of learning ability in cuprizone-fed mice and the decreased expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the hippocampus. And anti-LINGO-1 improved learning ability and partly restored MBP level. Furthermore, we also found kinesin light chain (KLC), neurofilament light chain (NFL) and neurofilament heavy chain (NF200) were declined in demyelinated hippocampus, which could be partly improved by treatment with anti-LINGO-1. However, we did not observe the increased expression of beta amyloid, hyperphosphorylation of tau and loss of neurons in demyelinated hippocampus. Our results suggest that demyelination might lead to the impairment of neuronal transport, but not cause increased level of hyperphosphorylated tau and beta amyloid.

This study aimed to determine the effects of a novel class of anti-CD20 mAbs on vascular and extravascular central nervous system (CNS)-infiltrating B cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Male hCD20xhIgR3 mice and wild-type C57BL/6 (B6) mice were immunized with human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)(1-125) to induce EAE. While hCD20xhIgR3 mice were injected intravenously with an anti-human CD20 mAb (5 mg/kg) (rituximab (a type I anti-CD20 mAb) or obinutuzumab (a type II anti-CD20 mAb), B6 mice received the anti-mouse CD20 antibody 18B12. Neither mAb affected clinical disease or serum antibody levels. Obinutuzumab and rituximab had an impact on splenic and CNS-infiltrated B cells with slightly differential depletion efficacy. Additionally, obinutuzumab had beneficial effects on spinal cord myelination. B cell depletion rates in the 18B12/B6 model were comparable with those observed in obinutuzumab-treated hCD20xhIgR3 mice.

In this study, we employed the murine cuprizone model of demyelination, in which remyelination occurs after removal of the toxin from the diet, to examine the cellular and molecular changes during demyelination and remyelination. Microglia accumulated in the corpus callosum during weeks 2-4 of the cuprizone diet, and these cells remained activated 2 weeks after the change to the normal diet. To examine the role of microglia in remyelination, mice were treated with minocycline to inactivate these cells after cuprizone-induced demyelination. Minocycline treatment reduced the number of CC1-positive oligodendrocytes, as well as levels of myelin basic protein (MBP) and CNPase in the remyelination phase. The expression of CNTF mRNA in the corpus callosum increased after 4 weeks on the cuprizone diet and remained high 2 weeks after the change to the normal diet.

The clinical and immunological effects of GA were extensively studied in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the experimental animal model for MS. The effect of oral administration of GA was tested in both rodents and primates in acute as well as in chronic relapsing (CR) models of EAE. Oral GA was found to suppress acute EAE induced in rats, mice, and rhesus monkeys. The effect of GA was also tested in several models of CR-EAE: proteolipid protein and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein induced CR-EAE in mice, CR-EAE in Biozzi mice, and CR-EAE in cynomolgus monkeys. In all the murine models, oral treatment with GA initiated at the peak of first relapse reduced the severity of disease and suppressed further relapses. Suppression of EAE with oral GA was associated with marked inhibition of spleen cell proliferation and Th1 cytokine (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) response to the respective autoantigens. GA-specific T cell lines of the Th2/3 type that inhibit EAE induction in vivo, similarly to those induced by injection of GA, could be isolated from spleens of GA-fed mice and rats. Furthermore, as demonstrated previously for GA-specific cells induced by the parenteral route, the orally induced GA-specific cells accumulate in the CNS and secrete in situ Th2 cytokines in response to both GA and MBP as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Although a clinical trial in MS with two doses of oral GA in enteric-coated tablets did not show a significant effect either at the clinical or immunological level, the results presented here suggest that oral GA may still be developed into a therapeutic modality in MS.",10.1196/annals.1309.055,https://doi.org/10.1196/annals.1309.055,PH,1,NA,EAE,"mouse, monkeys","Biozzi, rhesus",NA,NA,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,NA,2,0.4,NA,NA,2.4,NA,NA,mean,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EAE score for mice, Data for monkey also available",Teitelbaum_2004_ANYAS,JOUR,NA,"Adjuvants, Immunologic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use and Administration, Oral and Animals and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/drug therapy/*immunology and Glatiramer Acetate and Macaca mulatta and Mice and Multiple Sclerosis/drug therapy/immunology and Peptides/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use and Rats",eng,0077-8923 (Print) 0077-8923,239-49,1029,15681762,"Department of Immunology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, P.O.

In the present study we addressed the question of whether Cop 1 can induce oral tolerance to EAE similar to myelin basic protein (MBP). We now have demonstrated that oral Cop 1 inhibited EAE induction in both rats and mice. Furthermore, oral Cop 1 was more effective than oral MBP in suppressing EAE in rats. The beneficial effect of oral Cop 1 was found to be associated with specific inhibition of the proliferative and Th1 cytokine secretion responses to MBP of spleen cells from Cop 1-fed mice and rats. In all of these assays, oral Cop 1 was more effective than oral MBP. The tolerance induced by Cop 1 could be adoptively transferred with spleen cells from Cop 1-fed animals. Furthermore, Cop 1-specific T cell lines, which inhibit EAE induction in vivo, could be isolated from the above spleen cells. These T cell lines secrete the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor type beta, but not IL-4, in response to both Cop 1 and MBP. In conclusion, oral Cop 1 has a beneficial effect on the development of EAE that is associated with down-regulation of T cell immune responses to MBP and is mediated by Th2/3 type regulatory cells.

GA acts as a specific immunomodulator by binding to MHC Class II molecules, inducing specific T suppressor (Ts) cells and interfering with T cell responses to myelin antigens. MS patients treated with GA developed GA reactive antibodies, which peaked at three months and decreased at six months. In order to find out whether anti-GA antibodies may neutralize the therapeutic effect of GA, we tested both polyclonal (mouse and human) and monoclonal GA specific antibodies for their ability to interfere with the biological activity of GA in several assay systems. None of the antibodies interfered with GA activities either in vitro (binding to MHC molecules and T cell stimulation) or in vivo (blocking of EAE). Furthermore, 53 samples of sera obtained from 34 MS patients that participated in the open label trial in Israel, and all developed GA specific antibodies, were tested for their ability to inhibit the proliferation response of GA specific Ts cell clone and to interfere with GA competitive inhibition of the response to peptide 84-102 of myelin basic protein (MBP). None of the sera inhibited and some even enhanced the in vitro activities of GA. Furthermore, representative MS sera with high titer of GA reactive antibodies did not neutralize the biological activities of GA and did not inhibit Th2 cytokine secretion by human GA specific clone.

Thus, the development of therapies that are neuroprotective has elicited considerable interests. Estrogens and estrogen receptor (ER) ligand treatments are promising treatments to prevent MS-induced neurodegeneration and a multicenter phase II clinical trial of estriol as a beneficial therapy in MS is underway. Here, we discuss studies performed in our laboratory that examined the effects of ER ligands in the inflammatory/demyelinating disorder experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Administration of estriol or 17beta-estradiol reduced clinical severity and this clinical disease improvement was associated with favorable changes in cytokine production. There was a significant decrease of neuronal pathology in gray matter along with myelin and axon preservation in white matter of spinal cords of mice with EAE. In subsequent experiments, we contrasted the results of ERalpha versus ERbeta ligand treatment. While ERalpha ligand treatment was anti-inflammatory, ERbeta ligand treatment was not. ERbeta ligand treatment nevertheless reduced demyelination and preserved axon numbers in white matter and prevented neuronal abnormalities in gray matter. Clinically, ERalpha ligand treatment abrogated the disease at the onset, while ERbeta ligand treatment had no effect at disease onset, but promoted recovery. Thus, unlike ERalpha ligand treatment, ERbeta ligand treatment was protective at the level of the target organ, independent of anti-inflammatory effects in the peripheral immune system. ERbeta ligand treatment should be considered as a potential neuroprotective agent for MS and other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly since breast and uterine cancer are mediated through ERalpha.",10.1016/j.jns.2009.04.023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2009.04.023,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,NA,Estriol,control,1,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,mean,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Tiwari.Woodruff_2009_JNS,JOUR,44958,"Animals and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*complications/drug and therapy/genetics/metabolism and Estradiol/therapeutic use and Estrogen Receptor alpha/deficiency/metabolism and Estrogen Receptor beta/deficiency/metabolism and Estrogens/*therapeutic use and Ligands and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Knockout and Motor Activity/drug effects and Myelin Proteins/metabolism and Myelitis/etiology/*prevention & control and Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism and Neurodegenerative Diseases/etiology/*prevention & control and Neuroprotective Agents/*therapeutic use and Receptors, Estrogen",eng,0022-510X (Print) 0022-510x,81-5,286,19442988,"Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. seemaw@ucla.edu",NA,NA,Authors reported no conflict of interests,PMC2760614,45245,NLM,1212,"ASReview_relevant and 1878-5883 and Tiwari-Woodruff, Seema and Voskuhl, Rhonda R and R01 NS045443/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and R01 NS045443-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and R01 NS045443-04/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Netherlands and 2009/05/16 and J Neurol Sci. 2009 Nov 15;286(1-2):81-5. doi: 10.1016/j.jns.2009.04.023.

Effective GA treatment is associated with the induction of anti-inflammatory T(H)2 responses and antigen-specific expansion of CD25(+)/Foxp3(+) Tregs through the modulation of antigen-presenting cells. Here, we show that intravenous injection of fluorochrome-labelled GA resulted in rapid and specific binding of GA to CD11b(+) F4/80(lo) Ly6G(-) blood monocytes via an MHC class II-independent mechanism. Intravenous GA treatment enhanced the intrinsic capability of these monocytes to directly suppress T cell proliferation in vitro. The suppressive function correlated with reduced proliferation of myelin-specific T cells in vivo after intravenous GA treatment. In contrast, subcutaneous treatment with GA inhibited the pro-inflammatory IFN<ce><b3>-producing T cell phenotype rather than suppressing T cell proliferation. These data indicate that (1) GA engages directly with circulating monocytes to induce type II monocyte suppressor function; and (2) the therapeutic efficacy of GA may be expanded by employing different routes of GA administration to engage alternative mechanisms of suppression of autoreactive T cells in MS.",10.1111/j.1365-3083.2011.02575.x,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3083.2011.02575.x,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,both,10,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,NA,1,0,5,0,4.5,5,0.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Toker_2011_SJI,JOUR,3,"Animals and Antigens, Ly/analysis and Autoimmunity and CD11b Antigen/analysis and Cell Proliferation and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/*immunology and Glatiramer Acetate and Interferon-gamma/metabolism and Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism and Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Transgenic and Myelin Sheath/immunology and Peptides/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology and T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology and Th2 Cells/drug effects/immunology",eng,0300-9475,235-243,74,21595733,"Malaghan Institute of Medical Research, Wellington, New ZealandDepartment of T Cell Biology, Biopharmaceuticals Research Unit, Novo Nordisk A/S, MÃ¥lÃ¸v, Denmark.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Sep,NLM,1060,"ASReview_relevant and 1365-3083 and Toker, A and Slaney, C Y and B<c3><a4>ckstr<c3><b6>m, B T and Harper, J L and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and England and 2011/05/21 and Scand J Immunol. 2011 Sep;74(3):235-243. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.2011.02575.x.",Glatiramer acetate treatment directly targets CD11b(+)Ly6G(-) monocytes and enhances the suppression of autoreactive T cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Marketed,NA,427

S.",2019,Brain Pathol,Dimethyl fumarate impairs differentiated B cells and fosters central nervous system integrity in treatment of multiple sclerosis,"In multiple sclerosis (MS), the effect of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) treatment is primarily attributed to its capacity to dampen pathogenic T cells. Here, we tested whether DMF also modulates B cells, which are newly recognized key players in MS, and to which extent DMF restricts ongoing loss of oligodendrocytes and axons in the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, blood samples and brain tissue from DMF-treated MS patients were analyzed by flow cytometry or histopathological examination, respectively. Complementary mechanistic studies were conducted in inflammatory as well as non-inflammatory CNS demyelinating mouse models. In this study, DMF reduced the frequency of antigen-experienced and memory B cells and rendered remaining B cells less prone to activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Dissecting the functional consequences of these alterations, we found that DMF ameliorated a B cell-accentuated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model by diminishing the capacity of B cells to act as antigen-presenting cells for T cells. In a non-inflammatory model of toxic demyelination, DMF limited oligodendrocyte apoptosis, promoted maturation of oligodendrocyte precursors and reduced axonal damage. In a CNS biopsy of a DMF-treated MS patient, we equivalently observed higher numbers of mature oligodendrocytes as well as a reduced extent of axonal damage when compared to a cohort of treatment-na<c3><af>ve patients. In conclusion, we showed that besides suppressing T cells, DMF dampens pathogenic B cell functions, which probably contributes to its clinical effectiveness in relapsing MS. DMF treatment may furthermore limit chronically ongoing CNS tissue damage, which may reduce long-term disability in MS apart from its relapse-reducing capacity.",10.1111/bpa.12711,https://doi.org/10.1111/bpa.12711,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,NA,NA,Dimethyl fumarate,control,1,NA,"1,2",2.5,8.5,0.7,3.8,8.5,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Traub_2019_BraiPath,JOUR,5,"Adult and Animals and B-Lymphocytes/drug effects and Cell Differentiation/drug effects and Central Nervous System/drug effects and Dimethyl Fumarate/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/drug therapy and Female and Flow Cytometry and Humans and Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use and Longitudinal Studies and Male and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Middle Aged and Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy/immunology and Treatment Outcome and B cell and CNS demyelination and dimethyl fumarate and multiple sclerosis and repair",eng,1015-6305 (Print) 1015-6305,640-657,29,30706542,"Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Center, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany.

Human S1PR1 variants have been reported to have functional heterogeneity in vitro, suggesting that S1PR1 function may influence FTY720 efficacy. In this study, we examined the influence of S1PR1 phosphorylation on response to FTY720 in neuroinflammation. We found that mice carrying a phosphorylation-defective S1pr1 gene [S1PR1(S5A) mice] were refractory to FTY720 treatment in MOG(35-55)-immunized and Th17-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models. Long-term treatment with FTY720 induced significant lymphopenia and suppressed Th17 response in the peripheral immune system via downregulating STAT3 phosphorylation in both WT and S1PR1(S5A) mice. However, FTY720 did not effectively prevent neuroinflammation in the S1PR1(S5A) EAE mice as a result of encephalitogenic cells expressing C-C chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6). Combined treatment with FTY720 and anti-CCR6 delayed disease progression in S1PR1(S5A) EAE mice, suggesting that CCR6-mediated cell trafficking can overcome the effects of FTY720. This work may have translational relevance regarding FTY720 efficacy in MS patients and suggests that cell type-specific therapies may enhance therapeutic efficacy in MS.",10.1172/jci.insight.86462,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.86462,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,10,Fingolimod,control,3,NA,1,0.6,11,0.2,2.8,11,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Tsai_2016_JCIIns,JOUR,9,"Animals and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy and Fingolimod Hydrochloride/*pharmacology and Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Multiple Sclerosis and Phosphorylation and Receptors, CCR6/metabolism and Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/*chemistry and Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors",eng,2379-3708 (Print) 2379-3708,e86462,1,27699272,"Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.

However, the primary mechanism by which IFN-beta mediates its therapeutic effect remains unclear. Recent studies indicate that under defined conditions, IFN-beta may downregulate DC expression of IL-12. We and others have shown that IFN-beta may also downregulate IL-10. In light of the recently proposed paradigm that an IL-10/IL-12 immunoregulatory circuit controls susceptibility to autoimmune disease, we examined the effect of IFN-beta on the development and behavior of the autoreactive T cell repertoire during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model sharing many features with MS. SWXJ mice were immunized with the immunodominant p139-151 determinant of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), and at onset of EAE were treated every other day with IFN-beta. After eight weeks of treatment, we assessed autoreactivity and observed no significant IFN-beta effect on splenocyte proliferation or splenocyte production of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, or IL-5 in response to the priming determinant used to initiate disease. However, in IFN-beta treated mice, the cytokine profile in response to the priming immunogen was significantly skewed toward an increased production of IL-10 and a concurrent decreased production of IL-12. Moreover, the in vivo modulation of the IL-10/IL-12 immunoregulatory circuit in response to the priming immunogen was accompanied by an aborted development of epitope spreading. Our results indicate that IFN-beta induces a reciprocal modulation of the IL-10/IL-12 cytokine circuit in vivo. This skewed autoreactivity establishes an inflammatory microenvironment that effectively prevents endogenous self-priming thereby inhibiting the progression of disease associated with epitope spreading.",10.1016/s0165-5728(00)00384-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0165-5728(00)00384-2,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SWXJ,female,NA,Interferon Beta 1,control,1,NA,1,1.9,9,0.2,3,9,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Tuohy_2000_JN,JOUR,44958,"Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology and Animals and Disease Progression and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/drug therapy/*immunology/metabolism and Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology/metabolism and Female and Immunization and Interferon-beta/*pharmacology and Interleukin-10/*immunology/metabolism and Interleukin-12/*immunology/metabolism and Mice and Mice, Inbred Strains and Myelin Proteolipid Protein/immunology/pharmacology and Peptide Fragments/immunology/pharmacology and Th1 Cells/drug effects/immunology and Th2 Cells/drug effects/immunology",eng,0165-5728 (Print) 0165-5728,55-63,111,11063821,"Department of Immunology, Lerner Research Institute, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, 9500 Euclid Avenue, 44195, Cleveland, OH, USA. tuohyv@ccf.org",NA,NA,NA,NA,45231,NLM,1611,"ASReview_relevant and Tuohy, V K and Yu, M and Yin, L and Mathisen, P M and Johnson, J M and Kawczak, J A and NS-36054/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and NS-37476/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and Netherlands and 2000/11/07 and J Neuroimmunol. 2000 Nov 1;111(1-2):55-63. doi: 10.1016/s0165-5728(00)00384-2.",Modulation of the IL-10/IL-12 cytokine circuit by interferon-beta inhibits the development of epitope spreading and disease progression in murine autoimmune encephalomyelitis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Marketed,NA,430

Further, adoptive transfer of GA-induced CD8(+) T cells resulted in amelioration of EAE, establishing a role as a viable immunotherapy in demyelinating disease. Generation of these cells required indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), while suppressive function depended on non-classical MHC class I, IFN-<ce><b3>, and perforin expression.

D.",1994,Acta Neurol Scand,Effect of K+ channel blockers on the clinical course and histological features of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis,INTRODUCTION: Beneficial clinical effects of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) in multiple sclerosis (MS) have been reported. The use of 4-AP in MS is based upon its ability to facilitate conduction in axons blocked by demyelination. This improvement is due to blocking of potassium (K+) channels in these fibres. Because K+ channels also play an important role in immune mechanisms successful treatment with K+ channel blockers in neuroimmunological diseases may have several causes. Therefore it seems important to study effects of K+ channel blockers in animal models of autoimmune disease. MATERIAL & METHODS: We studied the effects of 4-AP and quinidine on actively induced acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Lewis rats. RESULTS: There was no effect on the incidence of the disease. The severity of the disease was also unchanged although the disease duration was slightly diminished in the treated groups. Immunohistological comparison between the animals of different groups showed no differences. CONCLUSION: We conclude that 4-AP and quinidine are not capable of significantly changing the clinical course of EAE.,10.1111/j.1600-0404.1994.tb02725.x,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0404.1994.tb02725.x,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,male,NA,Fampridine,control,0,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,only a short communication,Uitdehaag_1994_ActaNeurScan,JOUR,4,"4-Aminopyridine/*pharmacology and Animals and Brain/pathology and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*pathology and Male and Neurologic Examination/drug effects and Optic Nerve/pathology and Potassium Channels/*drug effects and Quinidine/pharmacology and Rats and Rats, Inbred Lew and Spinal Cord/pathology and Synaptic Transmission/*drug effects",eng,0001-6314 (Print) 0001-6314,299-301,90,7839818,"Department of Neurology, Free University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Oct,NLM,1807,"ASReview_relevant and Uitdehaag, B M and Polman, C H and de Groot, C J and Dijkstra, C D and Journal Article and Denmark and 1994/10/01 and Acta Neurol Scand. 1994 Oct;90(4):299-301. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0404.1994.tb02725.x.",Effect of K+ channel blockers on the clinical course and histological features of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Marketed,NA,433

Glatiramer acetate is a mixture of randomly synthesized peptides that induces both T cell activation and antibody production in all treated individuals. These observations prompted us to compare the independent effects of adoptively transferred GA-reactive T cells and antibodies in mice with chronic inflammatory demyelination induced by Theiler's virus. Transferred T cells had no effect on lesion load or the extent of remyelination. Purified polyclonal GA antibodies also did not alter lesion load, which suggests that neither GA T cells or antibodies were pathogenic. On the contrary, GA antibodies enhanced the normally low level of remyelination in chronic lesions. The antibodies, which were primarily immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 and IgG2, cross-reacted with oligodendrocytes, perivascular infiltrating cells, astrocytes, and neurons in spinal cord sections.

Here, we sought to study whether the effect of DMF can be detected using positron emission tomography (PET) targeting the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) in the focal delayed-type hypersensitivity rat model of multiple sclerosis (fDTH-EAE). The rats were treated orally twice daily from lesion activation (day 0) with either vehicle (tap water with 0.08% Methocel, 200 <c2><b5>L; control group n<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>4 (3 after week four)) or 15<c2><a0>mg/kg DMF (n<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>4) in 0.08% aqueous Methocel (200 <c2><b5>L) for 8<c2><a0>weeks. The animals were imaged by PET using the TSPO tracer [(18)F]GE-180 in weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 18 following lesion activation, and the non-displaceable binding potential (BP(ND)) was calculated. Immunohistochemical staining for Iba1, CD4, and CD8 was performed in week 18, and in separate cohorts of animals, following 2 or 4<c2><a0>weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Using the fDTH-EAE model, DMF reduced the [(18)F]GE-180 BP(ND) in the DMF-treated animals compared to control animals after 1<c2><a0>week of treatment (two-tailed unpaired t test, p<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>0.031), but not in weeks 2, 4, 8, or 18 when imaged in vivo by PET. Immunostaining for Iba1 showed that DMF had no effect on the perilesional volume or the core lesion volume after 2 or 4<c2><a0>weeks of treatment, or at 18<c2><a0>weeks. However, the optical density (OD) measurements of CD4(+) staining showed reduced OD in the lesions of the treated rats. CONCLUSIONS: DMF reduced the microglial activation in the fDTH-EAE model after 1<c2><a0>week of treatment, as detected by PET imaging of the TSPO ligand [(18)F]GE-180. However, over an extended time course, reduced microglial activation was not observed using [(18)F]GE-180 or by immunohistochemistry for Iba1(+) microglia/macrophages.

Rapid reversal of the antiproliferative activity of IFN-beta and excessive expansion of autoreactive T cells as disease promoting mechanisms,"IFN-beta has recently been shown to exert remarkable beneficial effects on disease development in patients with early stage relapsing-remitting MS. The specific immune mechanism(s) by which IFN-beta ameliorates this human demyelinating disease is at present undefined. One potential mechanism may reside in the antiproliferative activity of IFN-beta which may inhibit the expansion of autoaggressive T cells thereby limiting disease progression. In the present study we investigated whether the administration of recombinant rat IFN-beta (rrIFN-beta) to Lewis rats with actively induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) inhibits the expansion of encephalitogenic T cells in lymphoid organs and as such may contribute to suppression of disease activity in this widely used animal model for MS. Our data show that daily administrations of > or = 3 x 10(5) u rrIFN-beta to EAE rats, starting two days before MBP sensitization and continued for 10 days led to a dramatic and dose-dependent reduction in encephalitogenic T cells in both spleen and inguinal lymph nodes at day 8 post-immunization (p.i.). However, the rrIFN-beta-mediated reduction in effector T cells did not ameliorate paralytic disease as expected but significantly enhanced the severity of EAE. Analyses of lymphoid organs in the remission phase of EAE revealed strongly elevated numbers of encephalitogenic T cells in rrIFN-beta-treated versus control rats suggesting a rapid reversal of the antiproliferative action of rrIFN-beta followed by an overshoot in the subsequent expansion of these effector T cells. In conformity with higher numbers of encephalitogenic T cells and worsening of disease, animals also showed significantly greater perivascular inflammation in the CNS. The relevance of our findings in relation to the beneficial effects of IFN-beta in MS is discussed.",10.1016/s0165-5728(97)00207-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0165-5728(97)00207-5,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,female,10,Interferon Beta 1,control,2,NA,0,0,7,NA,0.2,7,NA,mean,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,recombinant rat interferon beta,van.der.Meide_1998_JN,JOUR,1,"Adjuvants, Immunologic/*administration & dosage and Animals and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy and Female and Interferon-beta/*administration & dosage and Lymph Nodes/*drug effects/physiology and Multiple Sclerosis/metabolism and Rats and Rats, Inbred Lew and Recurrence and Spleen/*drug effects/physiology",eng,0165-5728 (Print) 0165-5728,14-23,84,9600704,"Department of Immunobiology, Biomedical Primate Research Centre, Rijswijk, The Netherlands. meide@bprc.nl",NA,NA,NA,NA,45017,NLM,1706,"ASReview_relevant and van der Meide, P H and de Labie, M C and Ruuls, S R and Groenestein, R J and Botman, C A and Olsson, T and Dijkstra, C D and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Netherlands and 1998/05/26 and J Neuroimmunol. 1998 Apr 1;84(1):14-23. doi: 10.1016/s0165-5728(97)00207-5.",Discontinuation of treatment with IFN-beta leads to exacerbation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats.

A major goal in the development of immunomodulatory strategies is the discovery of combinations of drugs exerting synergistic immunomodulatory effects. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3, is an immunomodulator that interacts with T cells but mainly targets antigen-presenting cells. We have demonstrated synergism between 1,25(OH)2D3 and cyclosporine, rapamycin, and FK506. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this synergism could be observed with other immunosuppressants (mycophenolate mofetil, leflunomide, and the methylxanthine A802715) and whether analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 share this synergistic capacity in vivo. METHODS: In vitro, the median effect analysis was applied to the inhibition of phytohemagglutinin A-induced lymphocyte proliferation. In vivo, synergism between analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 and cyclosporine or mycophenolate mofetil was evaluated in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. RESULTS: In vitro, all combinations with 1,25(OH)2D3 were synergistic. The strongest synergism was seen with the inhibitors of interleukin 2 secretion, cyclosporine and FK506 (indexes 0.16 and 0.27, respectively). The weakest synergism was observed in combinations using A802715, a second-signal inhibitor (index 0.52), or the nucleotide synthesis inhibitor mycophenolate mofetil (index 0.43). In vivo, analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 share the in vitro-observed synergism with 1,25(OH)2D3. Moreover, the differences in synergism with different immunomodulators were also present in vivo, where the best synergism was again seen in combination with cyclosporine (up to 100% paralysis protection). CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogs are potent dose-reducing drugs for other immunomodulators, making them potentially interesting for clinical use in autoimmunity and transplantation.",10.1097/00007890-200005150-00032,https://doi.org/10.1097/00007890-200005150-00032,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SJL,female,9,Vitamin D3,control,1,439,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,van.Etten_2000_Tran,JOUR,9,"Animals and Bone and Bones/metabolism and Calcitriol/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology and Calcium/physiology and Dose-Response Relationship, Drug and Drug Synergism and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/prevention & control and Female and Humans and Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology and Interleukin-2/biosynthesis and Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects and Mice and Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology",eng,0041-1337 (Print) 0041-1337,1932-42,69,10830234,"Laboratory for Experimental Medicine and Endocrinology (LEGENDO), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium.",NA,NA,NA,NA,45061,NLM,1627,"ASReview_relevant and van Etten, E and Branisteanu, D D and Verstuyf, A and Waer, M and Bouillon, R and Mathieu, C and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2000/06/01 and Transplantation. 2000 May 15;69(9):1932-42. doi: 10.1097/00007890-200005150-00032.","Analogs of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 as dose-reducing agents for classical immunosuppressants",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,439

The strong immunomodulatory potency of TX527 is reflected by its ability to attenuate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of multiple sclerosis (MS). At present most MS patients are being treated with systemic IFN-beta administration. The aim of this study was to investigate whether combining IFN-beta with TX527 could empower its EAE-protective effects. We evaluated also combinations with the standard immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA). EAE was induced in SJL mice by PLP immunization, treatment was started 3 days before disease induction. The TX527+IFN-beta combination resulted in significant disease protection which was superior to the effect of both treatment separately. No disease amelioration, even aggravation, was obtained with the IFN-beta+CsA combination. By adding TX527 to the IFN-beta+CsA combination near complete protection from EAE was achieved (100% protection from paralysis, mean maximal score of 1.8+/-1.5, both p<0.05 versus controls and all individual treatments). From these data we conclude that adding TX527 to an IFN-beta and/or CsA treatment results in clear additional immunomodulatory effects in EAE prevention and is therefore a potentially interesting candidate to be considered in clinical intervention trials in MS.",10.1016/j.jsbmb.2006.12.094,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2006.12.094,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SJL,female,9,Interferon Beta 1,control,1,76,0,2.4,18,NA,1.2,17,NA,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,van.Etten_2007_JSBMB,JOUR,45049,"Animals and Body Weight and Bone and Bones/metabolism and Calcium/metabolism and Disease and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/immunology/pathology/therapy and Female and Interferon-beta/*immunology and Mice and Vitamin D/*immunology",eng,0960-0760 (Print) 0960-0760,546-51,103,17254771,"Laboratory for Experimental Medicine and Endocrinology (LEGENDO), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Herestraat 49, O&N1-bus 902, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Mar,NLM,1347,"ASReview_relevant and van Etten, Evelyne and Gysemans, Conny and Branisteanu, Dumitru D and Verstuyf, Annemieke and Bouillon, Roger and Overbergh, Lut and Mathieu, Chantal and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and England and 2007/01/27 and J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2007 Mar;103(3-5):546-51. doi: 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2006.12.094.

Attempts to block this pathway have been effective in preventing unwanted immune reactions. As B7 blockade might also affect Treg cells and interfere with negative signaling through membrane CTLA-4 on effector T (Teff) cells, its immune-modulatory effects are potentially more complex. Here, we used the mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS), EAE, to study the effect of B7 blockade. An effective therapy for MS patients has to interfere with ongoing inflammation, and therefore we injected CTLA-4Ig at day 7 and 9 after immunization, when myelin-reactive T cells have been primed and start migrating toward the CNS. Surprisingly, B7 blockade exacerbated disease signs and resulted in more severe CNS inflammation and demyelination, and was associated with an enhanced production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IFN-<ce><b3>. Importantly, CTLA-4Ig treatment resulted in a transient reduction of Ki67 and CTLA-4 expression and function of peripheral Treg cells. Taken together, B7 blockade at a particular stage of the autoimmune response can result in the suppression of Treg cells, leading to a more severe disease.",10.1002/eji.201445190,https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.201445190,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,6,Abatacept,control,3,NA,"1,2",0.9,10,0.1,1.2,7,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Vogel_2015_EuJoofIm,JOUR,6,abatacept and CD28 antigen and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 and gamma interferon and interleukin 17 and monoclonal antibody and monoclonal antibody B7 and monoclonal antibody Ki 67 and myelin and unclassified drug and animal experiment and animal model and animal tissue and article and autoimmunity and central nervous system disease and controlled study and cytokine production and demyelination and disease course and disease exacerbation and immunization and immunomodulation and inflammation and mouse and multiple sclerosis and nonhuman and priority journal and regulatory T lymphocyte and T lymphocyte activation,English,1521-4141 0014-2980,1832-1841,45,NA,"I.

However, the molecular and immunobiological mechanisms underlying 1,25D3's anti-inflammatory properties are not fully understood. We employed a murine model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in order to determine the role of NKT cells in 1,25D3-mediated protection from EAE. Wild-type (WT) mice or mice lacking all NKT cells (CD1d(-/-)) or invariant NKT cells (J<ce><b1>18(-/-)) were fed control or 1,25D3-supplemented diets. All mice fed with the control diet developed severe EAE. 1,25D3 treatment of WT mice protected them from developing EAE. CD1d(-/-) and J<ce><b1>18(-/-) mice treated with 1,25D3 were not protected to the same extent as WT mice. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-specific IL-17 and IFN-<ce><b3> production was significantly reduced in 1,25D3 WT mice compared with WT but was not decreased in 1,25D3 CD1d(-/-) mice compared with CD1d(-/-) mice.

IL-4(-/-) mice were not protected from developing EAE by <ce><b1>-galactosylceramide (<ce><b1>-GalCer) or 1,25D3 treatment. Furthermore, 1,25D3 treatment of splenocytes in vitro decreased <ce><b1>-GalCer-induced IL-17 and increased IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 production. 1,25D3 alters the cytokine profile of invariant NKT cells in vitro. These studies demonstrate that NKT cells are important mediators of 1,25D3-induced protection from EAE in mice and NKT cell-derived IL-4 may be an important factor in providing this protection.",10.1093/intimm/dxu147,https://doi.org/10.1093/intimm/dxu147,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,both,10,Vitamin D3,control,3,NA,0,0.5,8,0.3,2.7,8,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Waddell_2015_IntImm,JOUR,5,"Animals and Antigens, CD1d/genetics and Autoantigens/immunology and Calcitriol/*immunology/pharmacology and Cells, Cultured and Cytokines/metabolism and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*immunology and Female and Humans and Interleukin-4/genetics/*metabolism and Male and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Knockout and Multiple Sclerosis/*immunology and Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein/immunology and Natural Killer T-Cells/drug effects/*physiology and Eae and NKT cells and vitamin D",eng,0953-8178 (Print) 0953-8178,237-44,27,25574039,"Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA.

We and others have previously shown that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and alters CD4(+) T cell subpopulations. In this study, we investigated how EGCG impacts differentiation of na<c3><af>ve CD4(+) T cells into different effector lineages and report that EGCG impeded Th1, Th9, and Th17 differentiation and prevented IL-6-induced suppression of Treg development. We further showed that EGCG inhibited T-bet, PU.1, and ROR<ce><b3>t, the specific transcription factors for Th1, Th9, and Th17 differentiation, respectively. These effects, in turn, may be mediated by EGCG-induced downregulation of transducers p-STAT1 and p-STAT4 for Th1, and p-STAT3 for Th17. EGCG-induced change in Th17/Treg balance may be mediated by its inhibition of IL-6 signaling because EGCG inhibited soluble IL-6R, membrane gp130, and IL-6-induced phosphorylation of STAT3. This notion was further supported by the in vivo results showing inhibited IL-6 and soluble IL-6R but increased soluble gp130 levels in plasma from EAE mice fed EGCG. Together, our results suggest that EGCG modulates development of CD4(+) T cell lineages through impacting their respective and interactive regulatory networks ultimately leading to an attenuated autoimmune response.",10.1007/s00109-012-0964-2,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00109-012-0964-2,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Epigallocatechin gallate,control,1,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Wang_2013_JMM.,JOUR,4,"Animals and CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*drug effects/immunology and Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology and Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/immunology and Female and Interleukin-6/pharmacology and Mice and Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3/metabolism and Receptors, Interleukin/metabolism and Receptors, Interleukin-6/metabolism and STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism and Signal Transduction/drug effects and T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/immunology and Tea/*chemistry and Th1 Cells/cytology/drug effects and Th17 Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism and Th2 Cells/cytology/drug effects",eng,0946-2716,485-95,91,23064699,"Nutritional Immunology Laboratory, Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University, 711 Washington Street, Boston, MA 02111, USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Apr,NLM,953,"ASReview_relevant and 1432-1440 and Wang, Junpeng and Pae, Munkyong and Meydani, Simin Nikbin and Wu, Dayong and Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. and Germany and 2012/10/16 and J Mol Med (Berl). 2013 Apr;91(4):485-95. doi: 10.1007/s00109-012-0964-2.

In this study, we determined the effect of EGCG on the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model for human multiple sclerosis, and the underlying mechanisms. Female C57BL/6 mice were fed EGCG (0%, 0.15%, 0.3%, and 0.6% in diet) for 30 days and then immunized with specific antigen myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55. EGCG dose dependently attenuated clinical symptoms and pathological features (leukocyte infiltration and demyelination) in the central nervous system and inhibited antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and delayed-type hypersensitivity skin response. We further showed that EGCG reduced production of interferon-<ce><b3>, IL-17, IL-6, IL-1<ce><b2>, and tumor necrosis factor-<ce><b1>; decreased types 1 and 17 helper T cells (Th1 and Th17, respectively); and increased regulatory T-cell populations in lymph nodes, the spleen, and the central nervous system.

In addition to immunosuppression, neuronal protection by FTY720 has also been suggested, but remains controversial. Axial and radial diffusivities derived from in vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were employed as noninvasive biomarkers of axonal injury and demyelination to assess axonal protection by FTY720 in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. EAE was induced through active immunization of C57BL/6 mice using myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35-55 (MOG(35-55)). We evaluated both the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment effect of FTY720 at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg on EAE mice by daily clinical scoring and end-point in vivo DTI. Prophylactic administration of FTY720 suppressed the disease onset and prevented axon and myelin damage when compared with EAE mice without treatment. Therapeutic treatment by FTY720 did not prevent EAE onset, but reduced disease severity, improving axial and radial diffusivity towards the control values without statistical significance. Consistent with previous findings, in vivo DTI-derived axial and radial diffusivity correlated with clinical scores in EAE mice.

This anti-inflammatory cytokine shift was associated with reduced STAT-1 signaling. Type II monocytes directed differentiation of T(H)2 cells and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (T(reg)) independent of antigen specificity. Type II monocyte-induced regulatory T cells specific for a foreign antigen ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), indicating that neither GA specificity nor recognition of self-antigen was required for their therapeutic effect. Adoptive transfer of type II monocytes reversed EAE, suppressed T(H)17 cell development and promoted both T(H)2 differentiation and expansion of T(reg) cells in recipient mice.

Besides inhibiting development of encephalitogenic T cells, atorvastatin treatment of EAE has been associated with an induction of anti-inflammatory myelin-reactive T-helper type (Th)-2 cells. To investigate the clinical significance of atorvastatin-mediated Th2 differentiation, we first evaluated atorvastatin treatment in interleukin (IL)-4 green fluorescent protein-enhanced transcript (4-GET) reporter mice. Atorvastatin treatment failed to induce IL-4-producing Th2 cells in vivo; however, when T cells from atorvastatin-treated 4-GET mice were reactivated in vitro, T cells preferentially differentiated into Th2 cells, while antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (interferon gamma, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor and IL-12) were reduced. Oral atorvastatin also prevented or reversed EAE in signal transducer and activator of transcription 6-deficient (STAT6-/-) mice, which cannot generate IL-4-producing Th2 cells. Further, atorvastatin treatment did not induce or expand Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in either wild-type or STAT6-/- mice. In vivo proliferation of T cells, as measured by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine, was inhibited in atorvastatin-treated wild-type and STAT6-/- mice. These data imply that atorvastatin ameliorates central nervous system autoimmune disease primarily by inhibiting proliferation of proinflammatory encephalitogenic T cells, and not simply through induction of anti-inflammatory Th2 cells. This cytostatic effect may be a relevant mechanism of action when considering use of statins in MS and other inflammatory conditions.",10.1186/1742-2094-11-29,https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-11-29,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,10,Atorvastatin,control,1,NA,"0,2",0.8,12,0.3,2.2,12,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Weber_2014_JN,JOUR,NA,"Adenylyl Cyclases/genetics and Animals and Atorvastatin and Cell Differentiation and Cell Proliferation/drug effects and Cytokines/metabolism and Disease Models, Animal and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/chemically induced/*drug and therapy/genetics and Female and Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism and Heptanoic Acids/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Interleukin-4/genetics and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Mice, Transgenic and Pyrroles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Rats and STAT6 Transcription Factor/deficiency and T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*physiology and Th2 Cells/*physiology",eng,1742-2094,29,11,24498870,"Department of Neurology, University of California, 675 Nelson Rising Lane NS-215A, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA. zamvil@ucsf.neuroimmunol.org.",NA,NA,NA,PMC3922392,44963,NLM,845,"ASReview_relevant and 1742-2094 and Weber, Martin S and Prod'homme, Thomas and Youssef, Sawsan and Dunn, Shannon E and Steinman, Lawrence and Zamvil, Scott S and R01 AI059709/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and England and 2014/02/07 and J Neuroinflammation. 2014 Feb 6;11:29. doi: 10.1186/1742-2094-11-29.",Neither T-helper type 2 nor Foxp3+ regulatory T cells are necessary for therapeutic benefit of atorvastatin in treatment of central nervous system autoimmunity,NA,NA,20140206,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,449

Although immune modulation and suppression are effective during relapsing-remitting MS, secondary progressive MS (SPMS) requires neuroregenerative therapeutic options that act on the CNS. The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator siponimod is the only approved drug for SPMS. In the pivotal trial, siponimod reduced disease progression and brain atrophy compared with placebo. The enteric nervous system (ENS) was recently identified as an additional autoimmune target in MS. We investigated the effects of siponimod on the ENS and CNS in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of MS. Mice with late-stage disease were treated with siponimod, fingolimod, or sham. The clinical disease was monitored daily, and treatment success was verified using mass spectrometry and flow cytometry, which revealed peripheral lymphopenia in siponimod- and fingolimod-treated mice. We evaluated the mRNA expression, ultrastructure, and histopathology of the ENS and CNS. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed an upregulation of proinflammatory genes in spinal cord astrocytes and ependymal cells in siponimod-treated mice. However, differences in CNS and ENS histopathology and ultrastructural pathology between the treatment groups were absent.

We investigated the effect of dietary vitamin D3 content on de/remyelination in the cuprizone model, which is a well established toxic model of demyelination, with no associated lymphocyte infiltration. The mice received diets either deficient of (<50 IU/kg), or supplemented with low (500 IU/kg), high (6200 IU/kg) or very high (12500 IU/kg) amounts of vit D3. Cuprizone (0.2%) was added to the diet for six weeks, starting two weeks after onset of the experimental diets. Mouse brain tissue was histopathologically evaluated for myelin and oligodendrocyte loss, microglia/macrophage activation, and lymphocyte infiltration after six weeks of cuprizone exposure, and two weeks after discontinuation of cuprizone exposure. High and very high doses of vitamin D3 significantly reduced the extent of white matter demyelination (p<e2><80><8a>=<e2><80><8a>0.004) and attenuated microglia activation (p<e2><80><8a>=<e2><80><8a>0.001). No differences in the density of oligodendrocytes were observed between the diet groups. Two weeks after discontinuation of cuprizone exposure, remyelination was only detectable in the white matter of mice receiving diets deficient of or with low vitamin D3 content.

Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) manifests with serious physical disability. To quantitatively analyze differential protein expression in patients with SPMS, we performed two-dimensional fluorescence difference in-gel electrophoresis, followed by mass spectrometry on the cerebrospinal fluid of these patients and patients with other neurological diseases. Vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), gelsolin, albumin, etc. showed more than a 1.5-fold difference between the two groups. Based on these results, an experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis in Lewis rats was used to investigate DBP's role in the disease. Protein levels, mRNA transcripts, and ligands of DBP in different regions of the CNS were evaluated under various vitamin D intake levels. Here, DBP levels increased in the experimental rat groups compared to the control groups regardless of vitamin D intake. Moreover, DBP mRNA levels varied in different parts of the CNS including spinal cords in the experimental groups. The observed differences between DBP protein and mRNA levels in the experimental groups' spinal cords could be derived from the disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, an interaction between DBP and actin was confirmed using coimmunoprecipitation and western blot. These results indicate a role for DBP in the actin scavenge system. Moreover, in the experimental group that received oral vitamin D3 supplement, we observed both delayed onset and diminished severity of the disease. When DBP was upregulated, however, the benefits from the vitamin D3 supplements were lost. Thus, we inferred that high levels of DBP were adverse to recovery. In conclusion, here we observed upregulated DBP in the cerebrospinal fluid could serve as a specific diagnostic biomarker for the progression of multiple sclerosis. Next, we demonstrate the vital function of increased levels of free vitamin D metabolites for multiple sclerosis treatment. Finally, vitamin D supplements may be particularly beneficial for SPMS patients.",10.1007/s12035-012-8387-1,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-012-8387-1,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,male,7.5,Vitamin D3,control,1,20,0,0.75,10,0.25,2.5,10,0.25,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Yang_2013_MolNeu,JOUR,3,"Adult and Aged and Animals and Biomarkers/cerebrospinal fluid and Blotting, Western and Cholecalciferol/pharmacology and Disease Models, Animal and *Disease Progression and Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/cerebrospinal fluid/pathology and Female and Humans and Male and Middle Aged and Multiple Sclerosis/*cerebrospinal fluid/*pathology and Rats and Rats, Inbred Lew and Reproducibility of Results and Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization and Spinal Cord/metabolism/pathology and Up-Regulation/drug effects and Vitamin D-Binding Protein/*cerebrospinal fluid/chemistry",eng,0893-7648,946-56,47,23339019,"Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, Shandong 250012, People's Republic of China.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Jun,NLM,936,"ASReview_relevant and 1559-1182 and Yang, Mingchong and Qin, Zhaoyu and Zhu, Yanyan and Li, Yun and Qin, Yanjiang and Jing, Yongsheng and Liu, Shilian and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and United States and 2013/01/23 and Mol Neurobiol. 2013 Jun;47(3):946-56. doi: 10.1007/s12035-012-8387-1.

METHODS: EAE was induced in 7-week-old C57BL/6 female mice. Visual acuity (VA) was assessed daily to detect onset of ON after which daily oral-treatment with either fingolimod (1<c2><a0>mg/kg) or saline was given for ten weeks. In vivo DBSI scans of optic nerves were performed at baseline, 2-, 6- and 10-weeks post treatment. DBSI-derived metrics including restricted isotropic diffusion tensor fraction (putatively reflecting cellularity), non-restricted isotropic diffusion tensor fraction (putatively reflecting vasogenic edema), DBSI-derived axonal volume, axial diffusivity, <ce><bb>(<e2><88><a5>) (putatively reflecting axonal integrity), and increased radial diffusivity, <ce><bb>(<e2><8a><a5>) (putatively reflecting demyelination). Mice were killed immediately after the last DBSI scan for immunohistochemical assessment. RESULTS: Optic nerves of fingolimod-treated mice exhibited significantly better (p<c2><a0><<c2><a0>0.05) VA than saline-treated group at each time point. During ten-week of treatment, DBSI-derived non-restricted and restricted-isotropic-diffusion-tensor fractions, and axonal volumes were not significantly different (p<c2><a0>><c2><a0>0.05) from the baseline values in fingolimod-treated mice. Transient DBSI-<ce><bb>(<e2><88><a5>) decrease and DBSI-<ce><bb>(<e2><8a><a5>) increase were detected during Fingolimod treatment. DBSI-derived metrics assessed in vivo significantly correlated (p<c2><a0><<c2><a0>0.05) with the corresponding histological markers. CONCLUSION: DBSI was used to assess changes of the underlying optic nerve pathologies in EAE mice with ON, exhibiting great potential as a noninvasive outcome measure for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic efficacy for MS.",10.1016/j.nicl.2021.102732,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2021.102732,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Fingolimod,control,1,17,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Yang_2021_NeurClin,JOUR,NA,"Animals and Anti-Inflammatory Agents and Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Female and Fingolimod Hydrochloride/pharmacology and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and *Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology and *Optic Neuritis/drug therapy and Axonal loss and Demyelination and Fingolimod and Multiple sclerosis, diffusion basis spectrum imaging and Optic neuritis",eng,2213-1582,102732,31,34166868,"Department of Radiology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510640, China; Department of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.

The present study aimed to determine whether fingolimod therapy is beneficial to the visual system in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. A decrease in demyelination and axon loss in the optic nerve as well as cellular infiltration, especially the recruited macrophages, was observed in EAE with fingolimod treatment. Fingolimod administration diminished hypergliosis of macroglia, including astrocytes and M<c3><bc>ller cells in the retina and optic nerve in EAE. Microglia were hyperactivated in the retina and optic nerve in the EAE mice compared to controls, which could be alleviated by fingolimod treatment. Moreover, apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and oligodendrocytes in the optic nerve was significantly reduced with fingolimod treatment compared to that in the untreated EAE mice. These results suggested that fingolimod exerts neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects on the retina and optic nerve in a mouse model of EAE. Considering the paradox of favorable and side effects of fingolimod on visual system, we speculate that side effects including macular oedema caused by fingolimod during MS treatment is tendency to be vasogenic rather than hypergliosis in optic nerve and retina which warrants further neuroophthalmological investigation.",10.3389/fnins.2021.663541,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2021.663541,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,5,Fingolimod,control,1,48,2,0.5,12,0.1,2.1,12,0.1,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Yang_2021_FronNeur,JOUR,NA,Eae and fingolimod and glial response and multiple sclerosis and optic nerve and retinal degeneration,eng,1662-4548 (Print) 1662-453x,663541,15,33981197,"Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.

Fingolimod (FTY720) which is administrated as an oral medicine for relapsing-remitting MS has direct effects on neural cells. In this study, we hypothesized if daily treatment with FTY720 enhances endogenous myelin repair in a model of local demyelination induced by lysolecithin (LPC). We examined the response of inflammatory cells as well as resident OPCs and evaluated the number of newly produced myelinating cells in animals which were under daily treatment with FTY720. FTY720 at doses 0.3 and 1mg/kg decreased the inflammation score at the site of LPC injection and decreased the extent of demyelination. FTY720 especially at the lower dose increased the number of remyelinated axons and newly produced myelinating cells.

Here, we investigated the mechanism of this suppression. Methods EAE mice were treated from onset with FTY720 alone or in combination with an autoantigenic peptide of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35(MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK)55 (MOG35-55). Antigen-specific T cell activity and T cell subpopulations were analyzed by using flow cytometric analysis. Spinal cords were excised and examined immunohistochemically. Results After treatment with FTY720 alone, CD4+ T cells from inguinal lymph nodes (LN) maintained activity towards pathogenic autoantigen. The percentage of CD4+CD44highCD62Llow (effector memory) T cells in inguinal LN was significantly increased. At day 8 after discontinuation, infiltration of CD3+ and CD4+ cells in spinal cords was significantly increased, and the absolute number of CD4+ T cells in inguinal LN was decreased. However, in the case of combination treatment, the absolute number of CD4+ T cells in inguinal LN remained unchanged, and infiltration of CD3+ and CD4+ cells was significantly suppressed. Conclusions As the number of CD4+ T cells in inguinal LN was unchanged in the FTY720 plus MOG35-55 group, the combination treatment might inhibit relapse by decreasing the ability of pathogenic T cells to migrate from peripheral tissues to the central nervous system. The combination treatment might become a breakthrough remission-induction treatment for MS.",10.1111/cen3.12140,https://doi.org/10.1111/cen3.12140,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,NA,NA,Fingolimod,control,1,NA,2,0.8,6,0.2,2.4,6,0.2,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Yoshida_2015_CliandExpNeu,JOUR,1,fingolimod and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and animal experiment and animal model and animal tissue and article and CD3+ T lymphocyte and CD4+ T lymphocyte and controlled study and effector cell and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry and immunological tolerance and inguinal lymph node and mouse and nonhuman and priority journal and relapse and T lymphocyte and T lymphocyte subpopulation and fty 720,English,1759-1961,49-56,6,NA,T.

Treatment with IFNbeta results in a significant decrease in the rate of clinical relapse and a marked delay in progression to disability compared to placebo-treated control patients. In the present study, we demonstrate similar therapeutic effects after treating (SWR X SJL)F1 mice with IFNbeta at the onset of clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a disease animal model widely used in MS studies. EAE was actively induced by immunization of (SWR X SJL)F1 mice with the immunodominant encephalitogenic peptide 139-151 of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP). In blinded testing, mice treated with IFNbeta at EAE onset showed a delay in progression to clinical disability as determined by marked improvement with time in mean clinical score, significant delay in onset of relapse, and significant decrease in exacerbation frequency compared to placebo-treated control mice. The therapeutic effect of IFNbeta was accompanied by a significant inhibition of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) but not proliferation in response to the priming PLP 139-151. In addition, IFNbeta treatment resulted in an overall decrease in severity of both inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system. These results mimic in an autoimmune animal model the effectiveness of IFNbeta treatment observed in MS. Moreover, our study suggests that anti-viral properties of IFNbeta are not essential for producing therapeutic effects in autoimmune demyelinating disease, and that the efficacy of IFNbeta in the treatment of MS may be due to inhibition of autoreactivity.",10.1016/0165-5728(95)00160-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-5728(95)00160-3,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,(SWRxSJL)F1,female,NA,Interferon Beta 1,control,1,NA,1,2.3,13,0.3,3.7,18,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Yu_1996_JN,JOUR,1,"Amino Acid Sequence and Animals and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*therapy and Female and Hypersensitivity, Delayed and Interferon-beta/*therapeutic use and Mice and Molecular Sequence Data and Multiple Sclerosis/therapy and Recurrence and T-Lymphocytes/drug effects",eng,0165-5728 (Print) 0165-5728,91-100,64,8598395,"Department of Immunology, FFb-1, Research Institute, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Jan,NLM,1783,"ASReview_relevant and Yu, M and Nishiyama, A and Trapp, B D and Tuohy, V K and NS29095/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and NS29818/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and Netherlands and 1996/01/01 and J Neuroimmunol. 1996 Jan;64(1):91-100. doi: 10.1016/0165-5728(95)00160-3.",Interferon-beta inhibits progression of relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Marketed,NA,463

We have previously reported that in juvenile/adolescent rats, vitamin D supplementation protects from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Here we demonstrate that this protective effect associates with decreased proliferation of CD4+ T cells and lower frequency of pathogenic T helper (Th) 17 cells. Using transcriptome, methylome, and pathway analyses in CD4+ T cells, we show that vitamin D affects multiple signaling and metabolic pathways critical for T-cell activation and differentiation into Th1 and Th17 subsets in vivo. Namely, Jak/Stat, Erk/Mapk, and Pi3K/Akt/mTor signaling pathway genes were down-regulated upon vitamin D supplementation. The protective effect associated with epigenetic mechanisms, such as (i) changed levels of enzymes involved in establishment and maintenance of epigenetic marks, i.e., DNA methylation and histone modifications; (ii) genome-wide reduction of DNA methylation, and (iii) up-regulation of noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs, with concomitant down-regulation of their protein-coding target RNAs involved in T-cell activation and differentiation. We further demonstrate that treatment of myelin-specific T cells with vitamin D reduces frequency of Th1 and Th17 cells, down-regulates genes in key signaling pathways and epigenetic machinery, and impairs their ability to transfer EAE. Finally, orthologs of nearly 50% of candidate MS risk genes and 40% of signature genes of myelin-reactive T cells in MS changed their expression in vivo in EAE upon supplementation, supporting the hypothesis that vitamin D may modulate risk for developing MS.",10.1073/pnas.1615783114,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1615783114,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Dark Agouti,female,NA,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,NA,0.5,15,0.2,2,14,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Zeitelhofer_2017_PNASUSA,JOUR,9,"Animals and CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects and Cell Differentiation/drug effects and Cell Proliferation/drug effects and Down-Regulation/drug effects and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy and Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects and Genomics/methods and Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects and Multiple Sclerosis/drug therapy and Rats and Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology and Th1 Cells/drug effects and Th17 Cells/drug effects and Up-Regulation/drug effects and Vitamin D/*pharmacology and DNA methylation and epigenetics and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis and vitamin D",eng,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424,E1678-e1687,114,28196884,"Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, 171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.

Microglia play an important role in neuroinflammation. The M1 phenotype of microglia is involved in the proinflammatory process of the disease, while the M2 phenotype plays an anti-inflammatory role. Promoting the polarization of microglia to M2 in MS/EAE is a promising therapeutic strategy. This study is aimed at exploring the effects of BSYS on microglial polarization in mice with EAE. METHODS: The EAE model was established by the intraperitoneal injection of pertussis toxin and subcutaneous injection of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)(35-55) in C57BL/6J mice. The mice were treated with BSYS (3.02<e2><80><89>g/kg), FTY720 (0.3<e2><80><89>mg/kg), or distilled water by intragastric administration. H&E and LFB staining, transmission electron microscopy, qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, ELISA, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and western blotting were used to detect the histological changes in myelin, microglial M1/M2 polarization markers, and the expression of key genes involved in EAE. Results and Conclusions. BSYS treatment of EAE mice increased the body weight, decreased the clinical score, and reduced demyelination induced by inflammatory infiltration. BSYS also inhibited the mRNA expression of M1 microglial markers while increasing the mRNA level of M2 markers. Additionally, BSYS led to a marked decrease in the ratio of M1 microglia (iNOS(+)/Iba1(+)) and an obvious increase in the number of M2 microglia (Arg1(+)/Iba1(+)). In the EAE mouse model, miR-124 expression was decreased, and miR-155 expression was increased, while BSYS treatment significantly reversed this effect and modulated the levels of C/EBP <ce><b1>, PU.1, and SOCS1 (target genes of miR-124 and miR-155). Therefore, the neuroprotective effect of BSYS against MS/EAE was related to promoting microglia toward M2 polarization, which may be correlated with changes in miR-124 and miR-155 in vivo.",10.1155/2021/5521503,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5521503,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Fingolimod,control,1,40,1,3,10,1,6.3,10,0.8,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Zha_2021_OxiMedCelLon,JOUR,NA,"Animals and Body Weight/drug effects and Brain/*pathology and CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/metabolism and Capsules and Cell Differentiation/drug effects and Cell Polarity/drug effects and Cytokines/metabolism and Demyelinating Diseases/*genetics and Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/blood/*genetics/pathology and Exosomes/metabolism and Female and Inflammation/genetics/*pathology and Mice, Inbred C57BL and MicroRNAs/blood/genetics/*metabolism and Microglia/*pathology and Oligodendroglia/drug effects/pathology and Phenotype and Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism and Spinal Cord/pathology and Trans-Activators/metabolism and Up-Regulation/genetics",eng,1942-0900 (Print) 1942-0994,5521503,2021,33815654,"School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing Key Lab of TCM Collateral Disease Theory Research, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, China.

As it has the ability to modulate CD4+ T cell-dependent immune responses, its role in treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was investigated. EAE is a CD4+ T cell-mediated disease, the best available animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Two models of EAE were investigated, acute EAE induced in Lewis rats by inoculation with myelin basic protein (MBP-EAE) and chronic relapsing EAE induced in SJL/J mice by inoculation with myelin proteolipid protein peptide (residues 139-151) (PLP-EAE).

The remyelination process is mediated by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that Fingolimod, a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, stimulates OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes, in addition to its well-known anti-inflammatory effect. Using an animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we performed a dose-response study of Fingolimod (0.15 or 0.3mg/kg bw), which was initiated on the day of EAE onset. The neurological function was tested to determine the optimal dose of Fingolimod. Immunofluorescent staining was performed to measure the profile of OPC proliferation and differentiation. The mechanistic premise underlying the therapeutic effect of Fingolimod, was that Fingolimod stimulates the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway, and this pathway promotes OPC differentiation. To test this hypothesis, a loss-of-function study using cyclopamine, an inhibitor of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway, was employed in vivo. Protein levels of the Shh pathway were measured by Western blot analysis. We found that Fingolimod treatment (0.3mg/kg bw) significantly decreased cumulative disease score compared to the EAE control group. Concurrently, OPCs and proliferation of OPCs were significantly increased in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord at day 7 and day 30 after EAE onset, and oligodendrocytes, myelination and differentiation of OPCs were significantly increased at day 30 compared with the EAE control group. EAE mice treated with Fingolimod exhibited substantially elevated levels of Shh, its receptor Smoothened and effector Gli1 in the white matter of the CNS. However, combination treatment of EAE mice with cyclopamine-Fingolimod decreased Fingolimod monotherapy elevated protein levels of Smoothened and Gli1, and abolished the effect of Fingolimod on OPC proliferation and differentiation, as well as on neurological function outcome. Together, these data demonstrate that Fingolimod is effective as a treatment of EAE by promoting OPC proliferation and differentiation, which facilitate remyelination.

In<c2><a0>vivo, treatment with either FTY720 or NSCs alone had no effect on the secondary progressive stage of remitting-relapsing EAE, but a combination therapy with FTY720 and NSCs promoted significant recovery, including ameliorated clinical signs and CNS inflammatory demyelination, enhanced MBP synthesis and remyelination, inhibited axonal degeneration, and reduced astrogliosis. Moreover, FTY720 significantly improved incorporation and survival of transplanted NSCs in the CNS and drove their differentiation into more OLGs but fewer astrocytes, thus promoting remyelination and CNS repair processes in<c2><a0>situ.

Increased activation of CD4+T cells, especially the Th1 and Th17 subsets, is thought to play a causal role in this disease. IFN-<ce><b2> is widely used in the treatment of MS and is found to decrease IL-17 and OPN production in MS patients and EAE mice. However, a definitive molecular mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the immunomodulatory effect of IFN-<ce><b2> on the EAE model. We observed disease progression and determined the percentage of Th1/Th17 cells in the peripheral immune organs, brain, and spinal cord of mice. Furthermore, the levels of related cytokines and transcription factors were measured in splenocytes, and the effects of IFN-<ce><b2> on Th17 differentiation were assessed in vitro. Compared to the control group, IFN-<ce><b2> treatment significantly reduced the incidence of EAE and the associated pathological damage. Th1 and Th17 cells in IFN-<ce><b2>-treated mice were significantly reduced, and the levels of cytokines, such as IFN-<ce><b3>, IL-17, and OPN, were significantly decreased in splenocyte supernatants as well as the levels of corresponding transcription factors.

Prolactin, however, can elicit pro-inflammatory responses, and its use in the prototypical demyelinating and inflammatory condition, multiple sclerosis (MS), should thus be approached cautiously. Here, we sought to determine whether recombinant prolactin could alter the course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an inflammatory animal model of MS. Consistent with previous literature, we found that prolactin activated leukocytes in vitro. Daily treatment with prolactin from around the time of onset of clinical signs, for 9 (days 9 to 17) or 25 (days 9 to 33) days did not increase clinical or histological signs of EAE over that of vehicle-treated mice. Instead, the combination of prolactin and a suboptimal dose of recombinant murine interferon-<ce><b2> resulted in (days 9 to 17 group) or trended towards (days 9 to 33 group), a greater amelioration of clinical signs of EAE, compared to either treatment alone or to vehicle controls.

Our study demonstrates that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is upregulated in the serum and spinal cords of EAE rats, but that vitamin D reverses the upregulation to alleviate inflammation. Vitamin D, however, cannot prevent the disease process, suggesting that other factors may be involved. To identify additional factors that might limit vitamin D efficacy, we assessed the effects of vitamin D on plasma gelsolin (pGSN), a regulator of S1P that is downregulated in the CSF of MS patients. Our results show that pGSN is downregulated in the serum of EAE rats, whereas its cellular form, cytoplasmic gelsolin (cGSN), is upregulated in the spinal cord of EAE rats. Importantly, vitamin D causes a downregulation of both pGSN and cGSN, which may counteract the positive effects of S1P decrease. Furthermore, 48 and 42<e2><80><89>kDa caspase-3 cleavage products of cGSN are detected in EAE spinal cords, suggesting enhanced apoptotic activity, but these cleaved products undergo a similar decrease upon vitamin D treatment. To directly test the role of cGSN in the apoptotic process, we performed RNA interference in PC-12, a rat sympathetic nerve cell line.

R.",2012,Lab Invest,Estriol preserves synaptic transmission in the hippocampus during autoimmune demyelinating disease,"Cognitive deficits occur in over half of multiple sclerosis patients, with hippocampal-dependent learning and memory commonly impaired. Data from in vivo MRI and post-mortem studies in MS indicate that the hippocampus is targeted. However, the relationship between structural pathology and dysfunction of the hippocampus in MS remains unclear. Hippocampal neuropathology also occurs in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the most commonly used animal model of MS. Although estrogen treatment of EAE has been shown to be anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective in the spinal cord, it is unknown if estrogen treatment may prevent hippocampal pathology and dysfunction. In the current study we examined excitatory synaptic transmission during EAE and focused on pathological changes in synaptic protein complexes known to orchestrate functional synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. We then determined if estriol, a candidate hormone treatment, was capable of preventing functional changes in synaptic transmission and corresponding hippocampal synaptic pathology. Electrophysiological studies revealed altered excitatory synaptic transmission and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) during EAE. Neuropathological experiments demonstrated that there were decreased levels of pre- and post-synaptic proteins in the hippocampus, diffuse loss of myelin staining and atrophy of the pyramidal layers of hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1). Estriol treatment prevented decreases in excitatory synaptic transmission and lessened the effect of EAE on PPF. In addition, estriol treatment prevented several neuropathological alterations that occurred in the hippocampus during EAE. Cross-modality correlations revealed that deficits in excitatory synaptic transmission were significantly correlated with reductions in trans-synaptic protein binding partners known to modulate excitatory synaptic transmission. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a functional correlate to hippocampal neuropathology in any MS model. Furthermore, a treatment was identified that prevented both deficits in synaptic function and hippocampal neuropathology.",10.1038/labinvest.2012.76,https://doi.org/10.1038/labinvest.2012.76,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,14,Estriol,control,1,NA,0,0.3,5,0.1,4,5,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ziehn_2012_LabInv,JOUR,8,"Animals and CA1 Region, Hippocampal/drug effects and Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal/metabolism and Demyelinating Diseases/metabolism and Disks Large Homolog 4 Protein and Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/*metabolism and Estriol/*pharmacology and Female and Guanylate Kinases/metabolism and Hippocampus/*drug effects/metabolism and Histocytochemistry and Membrane Proteins/metabolism and Mice and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Microglia/metabolism and Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism and Synaptic Transmission/*drug effects",eng,0023-6837 (Print) 0023-6837,1234-45,92,22525427,"Interdepartmental Program of Neuroscience, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.",NA,NA,NA,PMC4343001,Aug,NLM,987,"ASReview_relevant and 1530-0307 and Ziehn, Marina O and Avedisian, Andrea A and Dervin, Shannon M and O'Dell, Thomas J and Voskuhl, Rhonda R and K24NS052117/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and T32 HD007228/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States and K24 NS062117/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and MH609197/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States and R01 NS051591/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and T32 HD07228-26/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States and R01 NS045443/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. and United States and 2012/04/25 and Lab Invest. 2012 Aug;92(8):1234-45. doi: 10.1038/labinvest.2012.76.

Myelin mapping techniques have the potential to provide tools for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity of T(2) *, frequency shift and susceptibility measures to myelin levels in a cuprizone mouse model of demyelination. The model was supplemented with two different dosages of fingolimod, a drug known to positively affect demyelination. A decrease in grey-white matter contrast with the cuprizone diet was observed for T(2) *, frequency shift and susceptibility measures, together with myelin basic protein antibody findings. These results indicate that T(2) *, frequency shift and susceptibility measures have the potential to act as biomarkers for myelination. Susceptibility was found to be the most sensitive measure to changes in grey-white matter contrast. In addition, fingolimod treatment was found to reduce the level of demyelination, with a larger dosage exhibiting a greater reduction in demyelination for the in vivo MRI results. Overall, susceptibility mapping appears to be a more promising tool than T(2) * or frequency shift mapping for the early diagnosis and treatment of diseases in which myelination is implicated.",10.1002/nbm.3877,https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.3877,PH,1,NA,cuprizone,mouse,C57BL/6,NA,6,Fingolimod,control,1,80,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.135,10,0.032,0.079,10,0.041,"mean, SD",T2*,NA,Ziser_2018_NMRBio,JOUR,3,Animals and Cuprizone and Fingolimod Hydrochloride/*pharmacology and Gray Matter/pathology and *Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Mice and Microglia/drug effects/metabolism and Myelin Basic Protein/metabolism and Myelin Sheath/*metabolism and Parvalbumins/metabolism and magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic susceptibility and myelination and ultra-high field,eng,0952-3480,NA,31,29266540,"Centre for Advanced Imaging, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) has been widely employed to evaluate new strategies to control MS, including procedures to induce immunological tolerance. Considering that skin exposure to protein antigens can induce tolerance and that vitamin D analogs conserve immunomodulatory potential and are less toxic, we investigated the efficacy of epicutaneous application of a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG(35-55)) associated with paricalcitol (PARI) on EAE development. Three and 11<e2><80><89>days after EAE induction, C57BL/6 mice were treated with an occlusive patch containing MOG plus PARI. Clinical parameters were daily assessed, whereas immunological and histological evaluations were performed during the acute EAE phase. MOG and MOG<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>PARI significantly controlled disease development reducing weight loss and clinical score. Moreover, MOG and MOG<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>PARI reduced the inflammatory process and preserved the myelin sheath in the CNS. High percentages of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) and lower MHCII fluorescence intensity in dendritic cells in draining lymph nodes were concomitantly observed. MOG<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>PARI association was, however, more efficient being able to reduce disease incidence and clinical scores more significantly than MOG or PARI alone. This experimental group also displayed a higher ratio between mRNA expression for Foxp3 and RORc and a higher percentage of Foxp3(+) cells in the CNS. Modulation of activation markers observed in microglial cells eluted from EAE treated mice were confirmed by in vitro studies with the BV-2 microglial cell line. The results show that MOG<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>PARI association applied by an epicutaneous route controlled EAE development. Protective involved mechanisms include mainly a higher proportion of Tregs and also a direct immunomodulatory effect of PARI on microglial cells.",10.3389/fimmu.2017.01198,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01198,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,6,Vitamin D3,control,1,41,1,0,6,0,2.2,5,0.4,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Zorzella.Pezavento_2017_FronImmu,JOUR,NA,Mog and epicutaneous route and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and regulatory T cell and vitamin D analog,eng,1664-3224 (Print) 1664-3224,1198,8,29085356,"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Biosciences, SÃ£o Paulo State University (UNESP), Botucatu, Brazil.",NA,NA,NA,PMC5650696,NA,NLM,498,"ASReview_relevant and 1664-3224 and Zorzella-Pezavento, Sofia Fernanda Gon<c3><a7>alves and Mimura, Luiza Ayumi Nishiyama and Fraga-Silva, Thais Fernanda Campos and Ishikawa, Larissa Lumi Watanabe and Fran<c3><a7>a, Thais Graziela Doneg<c3><a1> and Sartori, Alexandrina and Journal Article and Switzerland and 2017/11/01 and Front Immunol. 2017 Oct 16;8:1198. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.01198. eCollection 2017.",Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis Is Successfully Controlled by Epicutaneous Administration of MOG Plus Vitamin D Analog,NA,NA,20171016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Failed,NA,476

M.",2019,Mol Vis,Dimethyl fumarate mitigates optic neuritis,"PURPOSE: Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), a demyelinating autoimmune disease characterized by acute episodes of motor, sensory, and cognitive symptoms. Optic neuritis is an episodic sequela experienced by some patients with RRMS that typically presents as acute, monocular vision loss. Episodes of optic neuritis damage and kill retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and can culminate in permanent vision loss. The purpose of these studies was to evaluate the capacity of DMF to mitigate optic neuritis. The work presented combines studies of a mouse model of MS and a retrospective chart analysis of files of patients with RRMS treated at the MS Center of Excellence within the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. METHODS: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a well-established mouse model that recapitulates cardinal features of somatic and visual MS pathologies. EAE was induced in female C57BL/6J mice by inoculation with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (residues 35-55; MOG(35-55)). DMF or vehicle was administered twice a day by oral gavage. Visual acuity was measured longitudinally with optokinetic tracking. Post-mortem analyses included quantification of RGCs in retinal flatmounts and quantitative PCR (qPCR) of Nrf2 target genes and regulators of myelin. Retrospective chart analyses were performed using data obtained from deidentified files of patients with RRMS. RESULTS: In the EAE mouse studies, DMF decreased optic neuritis severity, preserved vision and RGCs, and concomitantly reduced motor deficits when administered by two different treatment regimens (prevention or interventional). DMF was more efficacious when administered as an interventional therapy, and the beneficial effects occurred independently of the induction of Nrf2 target genes. A complementary retrospective chart analysis demonstrated that DMF increased the time to a recurrence of optic neuritis, and protected against subsequent bouts of optic neuritis. CONCLUSIONS: This work underscores the potential of DMF to mitigate the severity and recurrence of optic neuritis episodes in patients with RRMS.",NA,https://doi.org/NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,14,Dimethyl fumarate,control,1,NA,"1,2",0.8,8,0.2,2.5,8,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Zyla_2019_MolVis,JOUR,NA,"Animals and Dimethyl Fumarate/pharmacology/*therapeutic use and Eye Proteins/genetics/metabolism and Female and Male and Mice, Inbred C57BL and Motor Activity/drug effects and Optic Neuritis/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology and Retinal Ganglion Cells/drug effects/pathology and Vision, Ocular/drug effects and Visual Acuity/drug effects",eng,1090-0535,446-461,25,31523122,"Aging and Metabolism Research Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK.
