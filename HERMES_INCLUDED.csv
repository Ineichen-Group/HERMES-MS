Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease whose pathogenesis combines all these processes. MS also involves impairment to the balance between the components of the intestinal microbiota, with development of dysbiosis. Various probiotics are widely used to correct dysbiotic conditions <e2><80><93> bacteria with proven useful properties. We report here the use of a model of multiple sclerosis <e2><80><93> experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) <e2><80><93> to study the ability of the probiotic Enterococcus faecium strain L-3 to decrease disease severity in rats when used alone and in combination with glatiramer acetate (GA). Administration of E. faecium L-3 was found to decrease the severity of EAE in rats to essentially the same extent as GA. However, simultaneous use of probiotic enterococci with GA produced no protective action. It is suggested that these agents stimulate different components of the immune system, as their actions produce increases in different populations of immune cells circulating in the blood. The study results demonstrate the ability of E. faecium L-3 to produce significant direct and indirect (via correction of dysbacteriosis) influences on the immune system in MS, which allows these bacteria to be regarded as a potential agent for immunocorrection in autoimmune, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative disease.",10.1007/s11055-017-0484-1,no,NA,"IEB, WZ, PH",1,NA,EAE,rat,Wistar,male,NA,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,90,1,2,20,0.3,3.7,30,0.5,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,rat,Marketed,NA

Immunomodulatory effects of atorvastatin and/or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) were determined in previous studies. The present study was set out to investigate the synergistic effects of combination therapy by suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and ATRA in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. EAE was induced by MOG35-55 in female C57BL/6 mice. Therapies were initiated at day 12 post immunization when the mice developed a disability score and continued throughout the study until the day 33 when animals were sacrificed. Therapeutic treatment with half doses of atorvastatin and ATRA in combination has synergistic benefits causing the regression of clinical and neuropathological features of EAE more favorable than treatment with full doses of either drug alone. Without any advantage in anti-proliferative effect, combination treatment significantly reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-17 and conversely, increased the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 more prominent than either drug alone. Furthermore, FoxP3+Treg cells were significantly increased only in combination treatment.

J.",2018,J Neurosci,Reduced Microglial Activity and Enhanced Glutamate Transmission in the Basolateral Amygdala in Early CNS Autoimmunity,"Emotional dysfunction is common in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and in mouse models of MS, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE); however, the etiology of these behaviors is poorly understood. To identify CNS changes associated with these behaviors, we focused on the basolateral amygdala (BLA) because of its central role in the regulation of emotional behavior. Whole-cell recordings were performed in the principal neurons of the BLA in early EAE, before demyelination, T-cell invasion, and motor dysfunction. EAE female mice displayed increased frequency of mEPSCs, with no alteration in amplitude or evoked EPSC paired-pulse ratio compared with controls. We found an increase in the AMPA-NMDA ratio and dendritic spine density, indicating increased numbers of glutamatergic synapses. We saw similar electrophysiological changes in BLA principal neurons after microglia were either inactivated (minocycline) or depleted (Mac1-Saporin) in the BLA. Microglia regulate synapses through pruning, directed by complement protein 3 (C3) expression. C3 was downregulated in the BLA in EAE. Ultrastructural analysis of microglia revealed more complex ramifications and reduced extracellular digestion of cellular elements. We also observed reduced IBA-1 and CD68 staining and lack of proinflammatory cytokine expression in the amygdala. Thus, early EAE is a state of microglial ""deactivation"" associated with reduced synaptic pruning. This contrasts with the prototypic microglial activation commonly associated with inflammatory CNS disease. Additionally, these data support a role for the acquired immune system to influence both neuronal and microglial function in early CNS autoimmunity.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Microglia help regulate synaptic homeostasis, but there has been little evidence for how this might be important in neuroinflammatory diseases. The data from this study reveal increased synaptic activity and spine density in early stages of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (an animal model of multiple sclerosis) in the basolateral amygdala, a nucleus important in the types of behavioral changes we have previously described. These electrophysiological and morphological effects occurred without significant elevation of local inflammatory cytokines or local demyelination. Unexpectedly, in the context of inflammatory state, we found that microglia were ""deactivated."" This study provides strong evidence for a link between microglial activity and synaptic function; the conclusions contrast with the generally accepted view that microglia are activated in inflammatory disease.",10.1523/jneurosci.0398-18.2018,no,NA,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,9,Minocycline,control,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Failed,NA

In contrast, anti-CD52 therapy at disease onset more fully suppresses experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice, and T cell repopulation is rapid. To test whether prolonged T cell lymphopenia promotes relapses, we thymectomized mice prior to EAE induction and anti-CD52 treatment. Thymectomy greatly reduced the number of recent thymic emigrant T cells and was associated with a prolonged reduction in CD4 T cells in peripheral blood. Two-thirds of thymectomized C57BL/6 mice had an EAE relapse post anti-CD52 treatment, while no surgery and sham surgery euthymic controls remained relapse-free.

However, there is a considerable lack of evidence when it comes to an age/developmental stage-dependent efficacy of vitamin D action and a time-window for the most effective prophylactic treatment remains unclear. We studied the effect of vitamin D supplementation in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, at three different developmental stages in rats. Supplementation treatment was initiated: i) prior to gestation and maintained throughout pre- and early postnatal development (gestation and lactation); ii) after weaning, throughout juvenile/adolescence period and iii) in adult age. We observed a marked attenuation of EAE in juvenile/adolescent rats reflected in a less severe CNS inflammation and demyelination, accompanied by a lower amount of IFN-<ce><b3> producing MOG-specific T cells. Moreover, the cytokine expression pattern in these rats reflected a more anti-inflammatory phenotype of their peripheral immune response. However, the same supplementation regimen failed to improve the disease outcome both in adult rats and in rats treated during pre- and early post-natal development.

METHODS: EAE was induced in three groups of C57BL/6 mice by immunization with MOG and administered intra-peritoneally 200 ngVD, PBS or olive oil (OO) from day +3 to +30. One group was also considered as healthy control group. At day 31, cytokines expression in the spinal cord and their serum levels were determined using real time-PCR and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: IL-12 gene expression and its serum levels in PBS-injected- or OO-administrated EAE groups were significantly higher than healthy group. IL-12 gene expression in EAE group treated with VD was significantly decreased compared to PBS-injected- or OO-administrated EAE groups (P<0.001 and P<0.02, respectively). Serum IL-12 levels were significantly reduced in VD-treated EAE mice compared to PBS-injected- or OO-administrated EAE groups (P<0.004 and P<0.05, respectively). No significant difference was observed between PBS-injected-EAE, OO-administrated EAE and healthy groups regarding the expression of TGF-<ce><b2>.

Here, we investigated whether peripheral immunomodulatory treatment for MS/EAE, glatiramer acetate (GA), can enhance neurogenesis and generate neuroprotection in the CNS of EAE-inflicted mice. EAE was induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide, either in yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) 2.2 transgenic mice, which selectively express YFP on their neuronal population, or in C57BL/6 mice. The in situ effect of GA was studied in various brain regions; neuroprotection and neurogeneration were evaluated and quantified by measuring the expression of different neuronal antigens and in vivo proliferation markers. The results demonstrated that in EAE-inflicted mice, neuroproliferation was initially elevated after disease appearance but subsequently declined below that of naive mice. In contrast, GA treatment in various stages of the disease led to sustained reduction in the neuronal/axonal damage typical to the neurodegenerative disease course. Moreover, three processes characteristic of neurogenesis, namely cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, were augmented and extended by GA treatment in EAE mice compared with EAE-untreated mice and naive controls. The newborn neuroprogenitors manifested massive migration through exciting and dormant migration pathways, into injury sites in brain regions, which do not normally undergo neurogenesis, and differentiated to mature neuronal phenotype. This suggests a direct linkage between immunomodulation, neurogenesis, and an in situ therapeutic consequence in the CNS.",10.1523/jneurosci.1859-05.2005,no,NA,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,9,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,NA,"1,2",0.25,6,NA,2,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

Their expression in the CNS after various insults is thus of major therapeutic consequence. Glatiramer acetate [(GA) Copaxone], an approved drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, has been shown to induce Th2/3 cells that accumulate in the CNS, expressing in situ antiinflammatory cytokines and BDNF. In the present study, we investigated whether s.c. injections of GA, applied at various stages of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, affect the expression of NTs, particularly BDNF, in the brain. In untreated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice, the expression of NTs was elevated shortly after disease appearance but subsequently declined below that of naive mice. In contrast, GA treatment led to sustained augmentation in the expression of BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4 in various brain regions as demonstrated by histological analysis of immunostained brain sections. GA treatment, even when started 45 days after disease induction, restored the impaired level of NTs to that of healthy mice. BDNF elevation after GA treatment was demonstrated on both protein and mRNA levels. Prominent staining was manifested not only by infiltrating GA-induced T cells, but also by CNS resident cells (neurons and astrocytes), indicative of a bystander therapeutic effect. Of importance, in GA-treated mice, intense BDNF expression was manifested by neuronal progenitors that migrated into lesions in injured regions.

Adoptively transferred labeled Cop 1-specific suppressor cells were found in brain sections 7 and 10 days after their injection to the periphery, whereas lysozyme-specific cells were absent in the CNS. Hence, Cop 1-induced Th2 cells cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the CNS, where they can be stimulated in situ by MBP and thereby exert therapeutic effects in the diseased organ.

Novel treatment strategies aim to operate within the CNS to induce neuroprotection and repair processes in addition to their anti-inflammatory properties. In this study we analyzed and compared the in situ pathological manifestations of EAE utilizing two different models, namely the relapsing-remitting PLP-induced and the chronic MOG-induced diseases. To characterize pathological changes, both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunohistochemistry were employed. The effect of the approved MS drug glatiramer acetate (GA, Copaxone) on myelin damage/repair and on motor neuron loss/preservation was studied in both EAE models. Ultrastructural spinal cord analysis revealed multiple white matter damage foci, with different patterns in the two EAE models. Thus, the relapsing-remitting model was characterized mainly by widespread myelin damage and by remyelinating fibers, whereas in the chronic model axonal degeneration was more prevalent. Loss of lower motor neurons was manifested only in mice with chronic MOG-induced disease. In the GA-treated mice, smaller lesions, increased axonal density and higher prevalence of normal appearing axons were observed, as well as decreased demyelination and degeneration. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of the relative remyelination versus demyelination, provides for the first time evidence of significant augmentation of remyelination after GA treatment. The loss of motor neurons in GA-treated mice was also reduced in comparison to that of EAE untreated mice. These effects were obtained even when GA treatment was applied in a therapeutic schedule, namely after the appearance of clinical symptoms.

Recently, second-generation PET radioligands that can reveal the extent of microglial activation by quantifying the increased expression of the 18-kDa translocator protein have been developed. Here, we investigate whether PET imaging can be used to demonstrate the reduction in microglial activation surrounding a chronic focal multiple sclerosis (MS)-like lesion after treatment with fingolimod, an established MS therapy. METHODS: Chronic focal experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE)-like lesions were induced in Lewis rats (n = 24) via stereotactic intrastriatal injection of heat-killed bacillus Calmette-Gu<c3><a9>rin (BCG) and subsequent activation using an intradermal injection of BCG in complete Freund adjuvant. This process resulted in a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)-like EAE lesion. The extent of neuroinflammation surrounding the lesion was measured using (18)F-GE180 as a PET radioligand. The imaging was performed before and after treatment with fingolimod (0.3 mg/kg/d by mouth, 28 d) or vehicle as a control. In addition to imaging, autoradiography and immunohistochemistry experiments were performed to verify the in vivo results. RESULTS: The chronic DTH EAE lesion led to increased ligand binding in the ipsilateral, compared with contralateral, hemisphere when PET imaging was performed with the translocator protein-binding radioligand (18)F-GE180. Treatment with fingolimod led to a highly significant reduction in the binding potential, which could be demonstrated using both in vivo and ex vivo imaging (fingolimod vs. vehicle treatment, P < 0.0001). The area of increased (18)F-GE180 signal mapped closely to the area of activated microglial cells detected by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: PET imaging, unlike MR imaging, can be used to visualize the microglial activation surrounding a chronic DTH EAE lesion. Importantly, the treatment effect of fingolimod can be monitored in vivo by measuring the degree of microglial activation surrounding the chronic DTH EAE lesion.

We show that the major green tea constituent, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), dramatically suppresses EAE induced by proteolipid protein 139-151. EGCG reduced clinical severity when given at initiation or after the onset of EAE by both limiting brain inflammation and reducing neuronal damage. In orally treated mice, we found abrogated proliferation and TNF-alpha production of encephalitogenic T cells. In human myelin-specific CD4+ T cells, cell cycle arrest was induced, down-regulating the cyclin-dependent kinase 4. Interference with both T cell growth and effector function was mediated by blockade of the catalytic activities of the 20S/26S proteasome complex, resulting in intracellular accumulation of IkappaB-alpha and subsequent inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. Because its structure implicates additional antioxidative properties, EGCG was capable of protecting against neuronal injury in living brain tissue induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate or TRAIL and of directly blocking the formation of neurotoxic reactive oxygen species in neurons.

Here we demonstrate that both subcutaneous and oral administration of atorvastatin inhibit the development of actively induced chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in SJL/J mice and significantly reduce the inflammatory infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS). When treatment was started after disease onset, atorvastatin reduced the incidence of relapses and protected from the development of further disability. Both the reduced autoreactive T cell response measured by proliferation toward the encephalitogenic peptide PLP139-151 and the cytokine profile indicate a potent blockade of T helper cell type 1 immune response. In in vitro assays atorvastatin not only inhibited antigen-specific responses, but also decreased T cell proliferation mediated by direct TCR engagement independently of MHC class II and LFA-1. Inhibition of proliferation was not due to apoptosis induction, but linked to a negative regulation on cell cycle progression.

METHODS: Using bioinformatics analysis of publicly available transcriptomics data, we determined the accumulation of B cells, plasma cells and T cells in different compartments of multiple sclerosis patients (MS) and healthy individual brains. Based on these observations and on the literature search, we dosed RTX in EAE mice either orally, or injected intraperitoneally (IP). The latter route was used either prophylactically (asymptomatic stage; upon the induction of the disease), or therapeutically (acute stage; upon the appearance of the first sign of the disease). Further, we used RTX as a preventive drug either as a single agent or in combination with other routes of administration. RESULTS: Because no complete recovery was observed when RTX was used prophylactically or therapeutically, we devised another protocol of injecting this drug before the onset of the disease and designated this regiment as prevention. We demonstrated that the 20 <ce><bc>g/mouse prevention completely reduced the EAE clinical score, impaired infiltration of T and B cells into the perivascular space of mice brains, along with inhibiting the inflammation and demyelination. However, the 5 and 10 <ce><bc>g/mouse doses although reduced all aspects of inflammation in these mice, their effects were not as potent as the 20 <ce><bc>g/mouse RTX dose.

This may be due to the fact that most EAE studies examine prophylactic, pre-treatment regimes that prove to be therapeutically-ineffective in long-established, often progressive, MS. FTY720 (fingolimod/Gilenya) is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator. This is a new oral agent that markedly reduces the number of relapses in people with MS, compared with currently licensed injectable agents such as the beta interferons. FTY720 has activity against lymphocytes but may also influence oligodendroglia and could therefore have the potential to influence progressive MS, by promoting remyelination. METHODS: The effect of FTY720 was assessed in relapsing-progressive EAE in mice. RESULTS: Early intervention during relapsing EAE could completely inhibit subsequent relapses, inhibited the accumulation of neurodegeneration, and facilitated motor recovery. However, when examined in secondary progressive EAE, that develops after the accumulation of deficit from relapsing disease, long-term treatment with FTY720 failed to slow deterioration when initiated late (4 months) into the disease course. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that early intervention with immunosuppressive agents may inhibit the generation of the neurodegenerative microenvironment, which is no longer responsive to potent immunosuppression. However, if treatment is initiated too late, progressive, neurological-disease continues unabated. This suggests that immunosuppression is insufficient to control secondary progression in animals, as has been found so far to be the case in MS, and may warrant early intervention with FTY720 for optimal treatment benefit.",10.1177/1352458511400476,no,NA,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,Biozzi ABH,both,7,Fingolimod,control,1,NA,"1,2",1.25,9,0.1,3.25,9,0.35,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

The current study aimed to investigate the possible therapeutic effects of combining vitamin D3 (Vit D3) and siponimod (Sipo) on enhancing remyelination and modulating microglia phenotypes in the cuprizone (CPZ) demyelination mouse model. The study was divided into two stages; demyelination (first 5 weeks) and remyelination (last 4 weeks). In the first 5 weeks, 85 mice were randomly divided into two groups, control (n = 20, standard rodent chow) and CPZ (n = 65, 0.3% CPZ mixed with chow for 6 weeks, followed by 3 weeks of standard rodent chow). At week 5, the CPZ group was re-divided into four groups (n = 14) for remyelination stages; untreated CPZ (0.2 ml of CMC orally), CPZ+Vit D3 (800 IU/kg Vit D3 orally), CPZ+Sipo (1.5 mg/kg Sipo orally), and CPZ+Vit D3 (800 IU/kg Vit D3) + Sipo (1.5 mg/kg Sipo orally). Various behavioral tasks were performed to evaluate motor performance. Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining, the expression level of myelin basic protein (MBP), and M1/M2 microglia phenotype genes were assessed in the corpus callosum (CC). The results showed that the combination of Vit D3 and Sipo improved behavioral deficits, significantly promoted remyelination, and modulated expression levels of microglia phenotype genes in the CC at early and late remyelination stages. These results demonstrate for the first time that a combination of Vit D3 and Sipo can improve the remyelination process in the cuprizone (CPZ) mouse model by attenuating the M1 microglia phenotype.

Here, we compared the effect of anti-CD20 therapy on microglial activation in two distinct focal rat models of MS. METHODS: The effect of anti-CD20 therapy on lesion formation and extralesional microglial activation was evaluated in the fDTH-EAE (experimental allergic encephalomyelitis) model, which is a focal demyelinating type-IV delayed-type hypersensitivity lesion. For comparison, effects were also assessed in the focal humoral MOG model induced by intracerebral injection of cytokine in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein immunized rats. Microglial activation was assessed in situ and in vivo using the TSPO SPECT ligand [(125)I]DPA-713, and by immunostaining for MHCII. The effect of treatment on demyelination and lymphocyte recruitment to the brain were evaluated. RESULTS: Anti-CD20 therapy reduced microglial activation, and lesion formation in the humoral model, but it was most effective in the antibody-independent fDTH-EAE. Immunohistochemistry for MHCII also demonstrated a reduced volume of microglial activation in the brains of anti-CD20-treated fDTH-EAE animals, which was accompanied by a reduction in T-cell recruitment and demyelination. The effect anti-CD20 therapy in the latter model was similarly strong as compared to the T-cell targeting MS compound FTY720. INTERPRETATION: The suppression of lesion development by anti-CD20 treatment in an antibody-independent model suggests that B-cells play an important role in lesion development, independent of auto-antibody production. Thus, CD20-positive B-cell depletion has the potential to be effective in a wider population of individuals with MS than might have been predicted from our knowledge of the underlying histopathology.",10.1002/acn3.94,no,NA,IEB,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,male,NA,Rituximab,control,1,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"animals ""at least 3 weeks old"". two different EAE models used: fMOG-EAE and fDTH-EAE.",Fingolimod,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,rat,Marketed,Marketed

The fusion protein CTLA4Ig can block this interaction and prevent specific T cell activation. The development of fatal CD4+ T cell-mediated experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in susceptible female Lewis rats was optimized by immunization with 20 mg of guinea pig spinal cord homogenate in CFA on day 0 with three doses of 1 microgram pertussis toxin given i.v. on days 0, 3, and 7. This immunization regimen uniformly resulted in the development of severe clinical neurologic signs of EAE with 100% mortality by day 17 postimmunization. Treatment with 0.5 mg/dose of rhCTLA4-Ig on days - 2, 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 significantly decreased the incidence, delayed the onset, and reduced the severity of clinical EAE (p = 0.0002 vs control by the Mann-Whitney U test) enough to completely prevent fatal EAE, whereas treatment with control human IgG had no effect. Histologically, perivascular neutrophilic infiltrates were also dramatically decreased in the spinal cords of animals treated with CTLA4 but not in those treated with control human IgG.

OBJECTIVE: The present study was carried out to examine whether Betaferon suppresses progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The EAE model was employed in guinea pigs in vivo, and mononuclear cell proliferation and 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity were assessed in vitro. RESULTS: Betaferon was more reactive in two assays of guinea pigs, mitogen-induced proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity of blood, than in rats and rabbits. Guinea pigs were immunized actively by antigen, porcine myelin basic protein. The neurological deficits were assessed by clinical signs scored daily.

There is also supporting evidence on the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in the neuro-protective action. However, its over production could contribute to brain disorders. In this study, demyelination was induced by ethidium bromide (EB) injection into the right side of the hippocampus area of male rats. Vitamin D3 was administered to rats for 7 and 28 days prior to behavioral experiments using Morris water maze (MWM). Travelled distance, time spent to reach the platform, and time spent in target zone, were considered for learning and spatial memory evaluation. Nitrite oxide (NO2-) concentration was measured as an indicator for nitric oxide production. The time spent to reach the platform and the travelled distance were decreased significantly by 28 days of vitamin D3 administration (compared to 7 days experiment). Time spent in target quadrant was significantly lowered by administered vitamin on day 28. Therefore, considering a number of studies that have shown the effect of vitamin D3 on cognition, these findings could support their potential effect.

However, this treatment is not always effective. Here we have found congruence in outcome between responses to IFN-beta in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). IFN-beta was effective in reducing EAE symptoms induced by T helper type 1 (T(H)1) cells but exacerbated disease induced by T(H)17 cells. Effective treatment in T(H)1-induced EAE correlated with increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) production by splenocytes. In T(H)17-induced disease, the amount of IL-10 was unaltered by treatment, although, unexpectedly, IFN-beta treatment still reduced IL-17 production without benefit. Both inhibition of IL-17 and induction of IL-10 depended on IFN-gamma. In the absence of IFN-gamma signaling, IFN-beta therapy was ineffective in EAE. In RRMS patients, IFN-beta nonresponders had higher IL-17F concentrations in serum compared to responders. Nonresponders had worse disease with more steroid usage and more relapses than did responders. Hence, IFN-beta is proinflammatory in T(H)17-induced EAE.

Alterations in the TJ proteins are common in inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) like multiple sclerosis (MS). Modulation of the BBB could thus represent a therapeutic mechanism. One pathway to modulate BBB integrity could be the induction of nuclear-factor (erythroid derived 2) related factor-2 (Nrf2) mediated oxidative stress responses which are targeted by fumaric acid esters (FAE). Here we analyze effects of FAE on the expression of TJ proteins in the human cerebral endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We show that dimethylfumarate (DMF) and its primary metabolite monomethylfumarate (MMF) induce the expression of the Nrf2/NQO1 pathway in endothelial cells. Neither MMF nor DMF had a consistent modulatory effect on the expression of TJ molecules in hCMEC/D3 cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF<ce><b1>)-induced downregulation of TJ proteins was at least partially reversed by treatment with FAE.

Here, we used this model to study the impact of the S1P(1) receptor modulator FTY720 (fingolimod) on the autoreactive B cell and antibody response both in the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS). METHODS: MP4-immunized mice were treated orally with FTY720 for 30<c2><a0>days at the peak of disease or 50<c2><a0>days after EAE onset. The subsequent disease course was monitored and the MP4-specific B cell/antibody response was measured by ELISPOT and ELISA. RNA sequencing was performed to determine any effects on B cell-relevant gene expression. S1P(1) receptor expression by peripheral T and B cells, B cell subset distribution in the spleen and B cell infiltration into the CNS were studied by flow cytometry. The formation of B cell aggregates and of tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) was evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry. Potential direct effects of FTY720 on B cell aggregation were studied in vitro. RESULTS: FTY720 significantly attenuated clinical EAE when treatment was initiated at the peak of EAE. While there was a significant reduction in the number of T cells in the blood after FTY720 treatment, B cells were only slightly diminished. Yet, there was evidence for the modulation of B cell receptor-mediated signaling upon FTY720 treatment. In addition, we detected a significant increase in the percentage of B220(+) B cells in the spleen both in acute and chronic EAE. Whereas acute treatment completely abrogated B cell aggregate formation in the CNS, the numbers of infiltrating B cells and plasma cells were comparable between vehicle- and FTY720-treated mice. In addition, there was no effect on already developed aggregates in chronic EAE. In vitro B cell aggregation assays suggested the absence of a direct effect of FTY720 on B cell aggregation. However, FTY720 impacted the evolution of B cell aggregates into TLOs.

Blocking adhesion molecules or preventing the effects of chemotactic mediators such as chemokines can be exploited to prevent immune cell recruitment to inflamed tissues. An anti-<ce><b1>4 integrin antibody (anti-VLA-4mAb/natalizumab (Tysabri<c2><ae>)) has been used as a treatment for MS and reduces leukocyte influx into the brain. In patients, anti-VLA-4 reduces relapses and disability progression. However, its mechanism of action in the brain is not completely understood. The anti-VLA-4mAb was demonstrated to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells. Interestingly, the chemokine SDF-1/CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 are also key factors regulating the migration of hematopoietic stem cells. Moreover, studies have revealed a crosstalk between SDF-1/CXCR4 and VLA-4 signaling in regulating cell migration. In this study, we address the effects of anti-VLA-4 on chemokine signaling in the brain during MS. We assessed the ability of anti-VLA-4 to regulate Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) and chemokine/receptor signaling. Preclinical administration of anti-VLA-4 delayed clinical signs of EAE. We found that anti-VLA-4 treatment reduced chemokine expression.

Here, we variously assessed the effects of an azide analogue of (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate (compound 5; a sphingosine kinase 1 activator), (R)-FTY720 methyl ether (ROMe, a sphingosine kinase 2 inhibitor) and RB-020 (a sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitor and sphingosine kinase 2 substrate) on IL-1<ce><b2> formation, sphingosine 1-phosphate levels and expression of S1P(1) receptors. We also assessed the effect of compound 5 and ROMe in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We measured IL-1<ce><b2> formation by macrophages, sphingosine 1-phosphate levels and expression levels of S1P(1) receptors in vitro and clinical score in mice with EAE and the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration into the spinal cord in vivo. KEY RESULTS: Treatment of differentiated U937 macrophages with compound 5, RB-020 or sphingosine (but not ROMe) enhanced IL-1<ce><b2> release. These data suggest that these compounds might be pro-inflammatory in vitro. However, compound 5 or ROMe reduced disease progression and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the spinal cord in EAE, and ROMe induced a reduction in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell levels in the blood (lymphopenia). Indeed, ROMe induced a marked decrease in expression of cell surface S1P(1) receptors in vitro.

However, very little is known about its effect on innate immune cells. In this study, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice were administered murine anti-CD52-Ab to investigate its effect on dendritic cells and monocytes/macrophages in the periphery lymphoid organs and the central nervous system (CNS). Our data show that blood and splenic innate immune cells exhibited significantly increased expression of MHC-II and costimulatory molecules, which was associated with increased capacity of activating antigen-specific T cells, at first day but not three weeks after five daily treatment with anti-CD52-Ab in comparison with controls. In contrast to the periphery, microglia and infiltrating macrophages in the CNS exhibited reduced expression levels of MHC-II and costimulatory molecules after antibody treatment at both time-points investigated when compared to controls. Furthermore, the transit response of peripheral innate immune cells to anti-CD52-Ab treatment was also observed in the lymphocyte-deficient SCID mice, suggesting the changes are not a direct consequence of the mass depletion of lymphocytes in the periphery. Our study demonstrates a dynamic and tissue-specific modulation of the innate immune cells in their phenotype and function following the antibody treatment. The findings of differential modulation of the microglia and infiltrating macrophages in the CNS in comparison with the innate immune cells in the peripheral organs support the CNS-specific beneficial effect of alemtuzumab treatment on inhibiting neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis patients.",10.1111/imm.13437,no,NA,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,9.5,Alemtuzumab,control,1,NA,2,0.8,10,0.25,3.2,10,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Anti-mouse CD52 monoclonal antibodies --> in drug name synonyms this antibody is listed as a synonym for alemtuzumab, however without ""murine""",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

In spinal cords of EAE mice, while the number of IL-33(+) cells remained unchanged, the extracellular level of IL-33 protein was significantly reduced in anti-CD52 antibody treated mice compared with controls. Furthermore the number of ST2(+) cells in the spinal cord of treated EAE mice was downregulated due to decreased inflammation and immune cell infiltration in the CNS.

Pathogenesis may be antibody independent, as B cell depletion therapy (BCDT) leads to amelioration of disease irrespective of autoantibody ablation. However, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. We demonstrate that BCDT alleviates central nervous system autoimmunity through ablation of IL-6-secreting pathogenic B cells. B cells from mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) secreted elevated levels of IL-6 compared with B cells from naive controls, and mice with a B cell-specific IL-6 deficiency showed less severe disease than mice with wild-type B cells. Moreover, BCDT ameliorated EAE only in mice with IL-6-sufficient B cells. This mechanism of pathogenesis may also operate in multiple sclerosis (MS) because B cells from MS patients produced more IL-6 than B cells from healthy controls, and this abnormality was normalized with B cell reconstitution after Rituximab treatment. This suggests that BCDT improved disease progression, at least partly, by eliminating IL-6-producing B cells in MS patients. Taking these data together, we conclude that IL-6 secretion is a major mechanism of B cell-driven pathogenesis in T cell-mediated autoimmune disease such as EAE and MS.",10.1084/jem.20111675,no,NA,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,NA,NA,7,Rituximab,control,1,NA,2,2.8,NA,0.35,4.2,NA,0.5,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

Estriol was also effective but at doses below those previously established for pregnancy. The reduction in disease severity was accompanied by a coincident reduction in the number and size of inflammatory foci in the CNS of estrogen (17<ce><b2>-estradiol or estriol)-treated mice. Recipients of encephalitogenic T cells from low-dose estrogen-treated mice developed less severe paralysis than mice receiving T cells from placebo-treated mice. A modest shift in Th1/Th2 balance suggested that low dose estrogen therapy could bias the immune reaction toward a protective anti-inflammatory cytokine response. However, estrogen treatment at the onset of active EAE failed to reduce disease severity, a result that is consistent with the hypothesis that naive cells are more sensitive to sex hormones than differentiated effector cells.

However, complete disease prevention only occurs with doses that dramatically elevate serum calcium levels, thus limiting the usefulness of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) as a potential MS therapeutic agent. Because calcitonin (CT) is believed to be released by hypercalcemia and has been shown to be anti-inflammatory, we examined whether suppression of EAE by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) could be mediated either in part or entirely by CT. Continuous administration of pharmacological doses of CT did not prevent EAE. However, a combination of CT and a subtherapeutic dose of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) additively suppressed EAE without causing hypercalcemia.

Calcium appears to be a critical component of 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated suppression of EAE, as complete disease prevention only occurs with a concomitant increase in serum calcium levels. Calcitonin (CT) is a peptide hormone released in response to acute increases in serum calcium, which led us to explore its importance in 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated suppression of EAE. Previously, we discovered that co-administration of pharmacological doses of CT enhanced the suppressive effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on EAE, suggesting CT may play a role in 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated suppression of EAE. To determine the importance of CT in EAE we have utilized a mouse strain in which the gene encoding CT and its alternative splice product, calcitonin gene related peptide-<ce><b1> (CGRP), have been deleted. Deletion of the CT/CGRP gene had no effect on EAE progression. Furthermore, treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 suppressed EAE in CT/CGRP knock-out mice equal to that in wild type mice.

One potential environmental factor is sunlight and the subsequent production of vitamin D. A number of studies have correlated decreased exposure to UV radiation (UVR) and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) [25(OH)D(3)] levels with an increased risk for developing MS. Furthermore, both UVR and the active form of vitamin D, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3), suppress disease in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model of MS. These observations led to the hypothesis that UVR likely suppresses disease through the increased production of vitamin D. However, UVR can suppress the immune system independent of vitamin D. Therefore, it is unclear whether UVR, vitamin D, or both are necessary for the putative decrease in MS susceptibility. We have probed the ability of UVR to suppress disease in the EAE model of MS and assessed the effect of UVR on serum 25(OH)D(3) and calcium levels. Our results indicate that continuous treatment with UVR dramatically suppresses clinical signs of EAE. Interestingly, disease suppression occurs with only a modest, transient increase in serum 25(OH)D(3) levels. Further analysis demonstrated that the levels of 25(OH)D(3) obtained upon UVR treatment were insufficient to suppress EAE independent of UVR treatment. These results suggest that UVR is likely suppressing disease independent of vitamin D production, and that vitamin D supplementation alone may not replace the ability of sunlight to reduce MS susceptibility.",10.1073/pnas.1001119107,no,NA,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,8,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,0,0.15,16,NA,2.15,16,NA,mean,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"in a table showing clinical score at peak severity etc --> mean and SD given (this is however not the case in the clinical score graph, where no variance measure is given). ; data from activated VitD (calcitriol) extracted. this paper however also analyzed clinical score of treatment with molecule that is the middle step of the activation process ( 25-hydroxyvitamin D3), which was not extracted here (and also had lower effect size than activated VitD3).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Failed,NA

Although there are potent disease-modifying agents for its initial relapsing-remitting phase, immunosuppressive therapies show limited efficacy in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Although modulation of sphingosine-1 phosphate receptors has proven beneficial during SPMS, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this project, we followed the hypothesis that siponimod, a sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor modulator, exerts protective effects by direct modulation of glia cell function (i.e., either astrocytes, microglia, or oligodendrocytes). To this end, we used the toxin-mediated, nonautoimmune MS animal model of cuprizone (Cup) intoxication. On the histological level, siponimod ameliorated cuprizone-induced oligodendrocyte degeneration, demyelination, and axonal injury. Protective effects were evident as well using GE180 translocator protein 18-kDa (TSPO) imaging with positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging or next generation sequencing (NGS). Siponimod also ameliorated the cuprizone-induced pathologies in Rag1-deficient mice, demonstrating that the protection is independent of T and B cell modulation. Proinflammatory responses in primary mixed astrocytes/microglia cell cultures were not modulated by siponimod, suggesting that other cell types than microglia and astrocytes are targeted. Of note, siponimod completely lost its protective effects in S1pr5-deficient mice, suggesting direct protection of degenerating oligodendrocytes.

Accordingly, copolymer 1, a random synthetic amino acid copolymer crossreactive with MBP and highly protective against the induction of EAE with MBP or PLP, is not being extensively tested in clinical studies as a therapeutic agent for MS. However, increasing evidence suggests that autoimmune reactivity against other CNS-specific myelin proteins could also be involved in the pathogenesis of MS. In this context, we have demonstrated that peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with MS respond predominantly to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) rather than to MBP or PLP, suggesting an important role for cell reactivity against MOG in the pathogenesis of MS. We have demonstrated that T-cell reactivity in MOG can also be pathogenic by inducing neurological disease in H-2u and H-2b mice with the same peptide of MOG, pMOG 35-55. Most interestingly, the expression of the disease differed with the different MHC backgrounds. Induction of a differentially expressed disease in different strains of mice with the same myelin antigen makes this new model particularly relevant to MS, where different expression of the disease is seen in different patients. Therefore, notwithstanding the importance of the autoimmune reactivity to MBP and PLP in MS, the potentially pathogenic autoimmune reactivity to MOG must now also be taken into consideration in therapeutic approaches to MS. In this context, we have investigated the possible effect of copolymer 1 treatment on autoimmune reactivity to MOG and on the development of EAE induced by MOG. Copolymer 1 was found to inhibit the binding of MOG peptides to MHC molecules, as well as the proliferation of MOG-reactive T cells, in a dose-dependent manner. In parallel, injection of copolymer 1 concomitantly with the encephalitogenic MOG peptide exerted a strong protective effect against the development of EAE. These preliminary data on the effect of copolymer 1 on the autoimmune response to MOG in mice indicate that copolymer 1 may also be effective in cases of MS where the autoimmune response to MOG prevails, and should therefore be further investigated in this context.",10.1007/bf00873697,no,NA,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,NA,NA,Glatiramer acetate,NA,1,10,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

Exercised-DMF treated animals showed an increased microglial/macrophage response on both ventral and dorsal horn that were associated with clinical improvement and synaptic motoneuron inputs density.

OBJECTIVE: Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) with DMF were developed for subcutaneous administration. METHODS: DMF-incorporated SLNs and free DMF were tested in mice induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). RESULTS: Preventive treatment of free or incorporated DMF were able to reduce the EAE clinical scores, increase the weight of the animals, reduce the lesion area (demyelination and infiltration), reduce microglial fluorescence intensity and reduce the number of microglial cells and astrocytes, when compared to untreated EAE animals. Groups that received DMF had reduced numbers of T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells in the blood, when compared to the non-induced group. CONCLUSIONS: DMF incorporated in SLNs was as effective as free DMF in reducing the clinical scores of the animals, but with reduced administrations when given subcutaneously.

A new generation of spontaneous experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse models has been developed that mimic certain aspects of multiple sclerosis spectrum disorders. We assessed the effects of GA in the opticospinal encephalomyelitis model, which involves MOG35-55 peptide-specific T cells and B cells. A nonsignificant trend toward lower disease incidence was found for GA treatment (started on postnatal day 20). Immunohistochemical evaluations revealed no significant differences for inflammatory lesions and demyelination, cytokine production, proliferation, and cell surface markers of immune cells between GA-treated and PBS-treated (control) mice. Although a good correlation was found between the disease score of individual mice and some readout parameters (eg, immunohistochemical staining), this was not the case for others (eg, IFN-<ce><b3> production). It seems plausible that a major effect of GA lies on alternative immunological pathways, such as initiating of an immune response that is not sufficiently reflected in this spontaneous experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model. Thus, the main advantage of the opticospinal encephalomyelitis model in our hands lies in the elucidation of factors influencing the onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eg, susceptibility factors).

Clinical trials defined that systemic administration of alemtuzumab reduces disease severity in the relapsing-remitting phase of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, its efficacy in progressive MS patients is limited, which may reflect the inability of alemtuzumab to cross the reconstituted BBB in these patients. Objective: to study whether central nervous system (CNS) delivery of anti-CD52 antibodies reduces disease severity and the neuroinflammatory burden in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. METHODS: Anti-CD52 antibodies were administered intrathecally during the acute and chronic phases of EAE. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry were utilized to define immunological and pathological parameters. RESULTS: We show that subcutaneously administrated anti-CD52 antibodies completely abolish EAE disease severity. CNS delivery of anti-CD52 antibodies during both the acute and chronic phases of EAE moderately reduces disease severity and the neuroinflammatory burden. Our findings further suggest that CNS delivery of anti-CD52 antibodies impacts both the peripheral and CNS immune cell compartments in the EAE model but not in healthy mice.

As an antigen-based therapy, GA induces GA-specific antibodies in treated patients and animals. GA-specific antibodies do not neutralize therapeutic effects on relapses and disability. Rather, it has been suggested that GA-specific antibodies may be associated with improved clinical outcomes. We evaluated antibody responses in eight patients with RRMS treated with GA for 15months and antibody responses in GA-treated C57BL/6 mice before and after induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). There were no significant differences from pretreatment levels of total IgE or GA-specific IgE in patients with RRMS. Total IgG1, IgG3 and GA-specific IgG4 were significantly increased at 15months of GA treatment. Antibody type and titre were not associated with clinical outcomes, i.e. expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score, disease burden on magnetic resonance images (MRI) or clinical relapses. In contrast, mice with EAE showed a marked increase in GA-specific IgE and GA-specific IgG1 antibody responses. GA-treated mice demonstrated improved clinical symptoms and lower mortality than untreated controls. Our results suggest that antibody responses to GA are heterogeneous among patients with RRMS, with no apparent association between antibody response and clinical outcomes. Clinical improvements in EAE-induced GA-treated mice suggest that GA-specific IgE and IgG1 may contribute to GA treatment effects in EAE. <c2><a9> 2011 The Authors.

Our study aims at investigating whether oral fingolimod recovers presynaptic defects that occur at different stages of disease in the CNS of EAE mice. In vivo prophylactic (0.3 mg/kg for 14 days, from the 7th day post immunization, d.p.i, the drug dissolved in the drinking water) fingolimod significantly reduced the clinical symptoms and the anxiety-related behaviour in EAE mice. Spinal cord inflammation, demyelination and glial cell activation are markers of EAE progression. These signs were ameliorated following oral fingolimod administration. Glutamate exocytosis was shown to be impaired in cortical and spinal cord terminals isolated from EAE mice at 21 <c2><b1> 1 d.p.i., while GABA alteration emerged only at the spinal cord level. Prophylactic fingolimod recovered these presynaptic defects, restoring altered glutamate and GABA release efficiency. The beneficial effect occurred in a dose-dependent, region-specific manner, since lower (0.1-0.03 mg/kg) doses restored, although to a different extent, synaptic defects in cortical but not spinal cord terminals. A delayed reduction of glutamate, but not of GABA, exocytosis was observed in hippocampal terminals of EAE mice at 35 d.p.i.

RESULTS: Siponimod, when applied before disease onset, ameliorated EAE. This effect was also present, although less prominent, when treatment started at peak of disease. Treatment with siponimod resulted in a strong reduction of the extent of mELT in both treatment paradigms. Both B and T cells were diminished in the meningeal compartment.

When an alternate day administration schedule (CsA at 10 mg/kg and 1,25(OH)2D3 at 2 <ce><bc>g/kg, each given on alternate days from day -3 to +19 after disease induction) was used, all treated mice were completely protected clinically and histologically. The two drugs also showed additive effects on serum osteocalcin and urinary calcium and desoxypyridinoline excretion, but not on serum calcium concentration.

Fingolimod is a disease-modifying treatment that belongs to the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators. In addition to inhibiting T cell egress from lymph nodes, fingolimod promotes the immunosuppressive activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), whose monocytic subset (M-MDSCs) can be used as a biomarker of disease severity, as well as the degree of demyelination and extent of axonal damage in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. In the present study, we have assessed whether the abundance of circulating M-MDSCs may represent a useful biomarker of fingolimod efficacy in EAE and in the clinical context of MS patients. METHODS: Treatment with vehicle or fingolimod was orally administered to EAE mice for 14<c2><a0>days in an individualized manner, starting the day when each mouse began to develop clinical signs. Peripheral blood from EAE mice was collected previous to treatment and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from fingolimod to treat MS patients' peripheral blood. In both cases, M-MDSCs abundance was analyzed by flow cytometry and its relationship with the future clinical affectation of each individual animal or patient was assessed. RESULTS: Fingolimod-treated animals presented a milder EAE course with less demyelination and axonal damage, although a few animals did not respond well to treatment and they invariably had fewer M-MDSCs prior to initiating the treatment. Remarkably, M-MDSC abundance was also found to be an important and specific parameter to distinguish EAE mice prone to better fingolimod efficacy. Finally, in a translational effort, M-MDSCs were quantified in MS patients at baseline and correlated with different clinical parameters after 12<c2><a0>months of fingolimod treatment. M-MDSCs at baseline were highly representative of a good therapeutic response to fingolimod, i.e., patients who met at least two of the criteria used to define non-evidence of disease activity-3 (NEDA-3) 12<c2><a0>months after treatment.

Treating mice with 1, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and feeding them diets high in calcium can completely suppress the induction of experimental autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Experiments described here were carried out on mice in which development of EAE was induced. Mice were fed diets containing various amounts of calcium and 1,25-dihydroxychole-calciferol. Variables measured were as follows: 1) incidence and severity of EAE; 2) serum calcium concentrations; 3) body weight; 4) total number of cells in the lymph nodes; and 5) interleukin-4 (IL-4) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) mRNA levels. When calcium was removed from the diet, the incidence of EAE was reduced 20% in both males and females. Further, the lower the dietary level of calcium, the higher was the dose of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol required to prevent the symptoms. Thus, 1, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol was found most effective in mice fed a diet adequate or high in calcium. 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol treatment of mice fed high dietary calcium resulted in a decreased number of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and increased IL-4 and TGF-beta1 mRNA levels.

Unexpectedly, accumulating evidence indicates that patients who discontinue fingolimod treatment may be at risk of rehearsal of magnetic resonance (MR) and clinical disease activity, sometimes featuring dramatic rebound. We therefore developed in vivo and in vitro models of post-fingolimod MS rebound to unravel its cellular and molecular mechanisms. The impact of fingolimod withdrawal on T regulatory lymphocytes was also investigated by means of cytofluorimetric analysis and antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation assays. We show that mice with relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) undergo extremely severe, chronic disease rebound upon discontinuation of fingolimod. Remarkably, rebound is preceded by a burst of S1P1 overexpression in lymph node-entrapped lymphocytes that correlates with subsequent massive lymphocyte egress and widespread CNS immune infiltration. Also, consistent with the ability of S1P1 to counteract polarization and function of T regulatory lymphocytes their number and suppression of effector T cells is reduced by fingolimod suspension.

To investigate functional changes following demyelination in a well-defined, topographically organized neuronal network, in vitro and in vivo, we focused on the primary auditory cortex (A1) of mice in the cuprizone model of general de- and remyelination. Following myelin loss in this model system, the spatiotemporal propagation of incoming stimuli in A1 was altered and the hierarchical activation of supra- and infragranular cortical layers was lost suggesting a profound effect exerted on neuronal network level. In addition, the response latency in field potential recordings and voltage-sensitive dye imaging was increased following demyelination. These alterations were accompanied by a loss of auditory discrimination abilities in freely behaving animals, a reduction of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf-2) protein in the nucleus in histological staining and persisted during remyelination. To find new strategies to restore demyelination-induced network alteration in addition to the ongoing remyelination, we tested the cytoprotective potential of dimethyl fumarate (DMF). Therapeutic treatment with DMF during remyelination significantly modified spatiotemporal stimulus propagation in the cortex, reduced the cognitive impairment, and prevented the demyelination-induced decrease in nuclear Nrf-2. These results indicate the involvement of anti-oxidative mechanisms in regulating spatiotemporal cortical response pattern following changes in myelination and point to DMF as therapeutic compound for intervention.",10.1007/s00429-018-1680-7,no,NA,IEB,1,NA,cuprizone,mouse,C57BL/6,NA,10,Dimethyl fumarate,control,1,NA,"2,3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

Vitamin D(3) ameliorates the onset of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE); however, the direct effect of vitamin D(3) on T cells is largely unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In an in vitro system using cells from mice, the active form of vitamin D(3) (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)) suppresses both interleukin (IL)-17-producing T cells (T(H)17) and regulatory T cells (Treg) differentiation via a vitamin D receptor signal. The ability of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)) to reduce the amount of IL-2 regulates the generation of Treg cells, but not T(H)17 cells. Under T(H)17-polarizing conditions, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) helps to increase the numbers of IL-10-producing T cells, but 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)'s negative regulation of T(H)17 development is still defined in the IL-10(-/-) T cells. Although the STAT1 signal reciprocally affects the secretion of IL-10 and IL-17, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) inhibits IL-17 production in STAT1(-/-) T cells. Most interestingly, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) negatively regulates CCR6 expression which might be essential for T(H)17 cells to enter the central nervous system and initiate EAE. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our present results in an experimental murine model suggest that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) can directly regulate T cell differentiation and could be applied in preventive and therapeutic strategies for T(H)17-mediated autoimmune diseases.",10.1371/journal.pone.0012925,no,NA,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,9.5,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,NA,0.2,NA,0.25,3.6,NA,0.2,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"""Data are representative of three independent experiments with at least five mice per group."" --> exact number of mice not clear, therefore ""NA""",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Failed,NA

In this study, we found that vitamin D receptor expression was induced in a CD4+ effector T cell lineage, Th17 cells, which required the transcription factors, ROR<ce><b1>, ROR<ce><b3>t, and STAT3. Treatment of mice with an active ligand of vitamin D receptor (VDR), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D3), ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, accompanied with reduced IL-17 and IL-17F expression. In vitro, treatment of CD4+ T cells with the physiological doses of 1,25D3 preferentially inhibited cytokine production by Th17 cells, in a VDR-dependent manner, without affecting the expression of transcription factors or surface molecules. Moreover, at these concentrations, cytokine expression was suppressed only at protein but not at mRNA levels. Stimulation of Th17 cells with 1,25D3, in a concentration-dependent manner, induced the expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a molecule involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress and translational inhibition. In addition, overexpression of CHOP in developing Th17 cells suppressed their cytokine production.

Its anti-inflammatory mechanism has been reported as involving a shift in cytokine balance from Th1 to Th2 in the T-cell response against elements of the myelin sheath. In addition to the Th1 and Th2 groups, two other important pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-17 and osteopontin (OPN), are believed to play important roles in CNS inflammation in the pathogenesis of MS. In this study, we examined the potential effects of IFN-beta on the regulation of OPN and IL-17 in MS patients. We found that IFN-beta used in vitro at 0.5-3 ng/mL significantly inhibited the production of OPN in primary T cells derived from PBMC. The inhibition of OPN was determined to occur at the CD4(+) T-cell level. In addition, IFN-beta inhibited the production of IL-17 and IL-21 in CD4(+) T cells. It has been described that IFN-beta suppresses IL-17 production through the inhibition of a monocytic cytokine, the intracellular translational isoform of OPN. Our further investigation demonstrated that IFN-beta also acted directly on the CD4(+) T cells to regulate OPN and IL-17 expression through the type I IFN receptor-mediated activation of STAT1 and suppression of STAT3 activity. Administration of IFN-beta to EAE mice ameliorated the disease severity. Furthermore, spinal cord infiltration of OPN(+) and IL-17(+) cells decreased in IFN-beta-treated EAE mice along with decreases in serum levels of OPN and IL-21. Importantly, decreased OPN production by IFN-beta treatment contributes to the reduced migratory activity of T cells. Taken together, the results from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that IFN-beta treatment can down-regulate the OPN and IL-17 production in MS.

Our findings showed that the combination of these two drugs functioned better than when they were individually administered in EAE mice, as evidenced by decreased clinical scores, reduced inflammation and demyelination, and improved magnetic resonance imaging outcomes. Further studies revealed that the combined treatment prevented the reduction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA expression in cerebral cortex of EAE mice.

Its mechanism of action is thought to be immunological through an active phosphorylated metabolite, FTY720-P, that resembles S1P and alters lymphocyte trafficking through receptor subtype S1P(1). However, previously reported expression and in vitro studies of S1P receptors suggested that direct CNS effects of FTY720 might theoretically occur through receptor modulation on neurons and glia. To identify CNS cells functionally contributing to FTY720 activity, genetic approaches were combined with cellular and molecular analyses. These studies relied on the functional assessment, based on clinical score, of conditional null mouse mutants lacking S1P(1) in CNS cell lineages and challenged by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. All conditional null mutants displayed WT lymphocyte trafficking that responded normally to FTY720. In marked contrast, EAE was attenuated and FTY720 efficacy was lost in CNS mutants lacking S1P(1) on GFAP-expressing astrocytes but not on neurons. In situ hybridization studies confirmed that astrocyte loss of S1P(1) was the key alteration in functionally affected mutants.

Various other reports have shown a deficit in the expression of proteins associated with GABAergic neurotransmission in the neocortex of patients with multiple sclerosis and it was also demonstrated that the activation of GABAA receptors leads to an inhibition of glutamate release. Now, in order to evaluate the events that may affect the neuronal function in EAE synaptosomes, we analyzed the participation of the GABAergic system in glutamate release and in the flunitrazepam-sensitive GABAA receptor density. This revealed alterations in the GABAergic system of the frontal cortex synaptosomes from EAE animals. GABA induced a decrease in the 4-aminopyridine-evoked glutamate release in control synaptosomes which was abolished by picrotoxin, a GABAA receptor antagonist. In contrast, synaptosomes from EAE rats showed a loss in the inhibition of glutamate release mediated by GABA. Furthermore, the flunitrazepam-sensitive GABAA receptor density was decreased during the acute stage of the disease in synaptosomes from EAE rats. We also observed a loss of inhibition in the Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of synapsin I mediated by GABA in nerve terminals from EAE animals, which could explain the loss of GABAergic regulation on evoked glutamate release. The changes observed in the GABAA receptor density as well as the loss of GABAergic inhibition of glutamate release were partially reverted in cortical synaptosomes from recovered EAE animals. These results suggest that the decrease in the flunitrazepam-sensitive GABAA receptor density may explain the observed failure of GABAergic regulation in the glutamate release of synaptosomes from EAE rats, which might contribute to the appearance of clinical symptoms and disease progression.",10.1016/j.neuroscience.2011.05.005,no,NA,IEB,1,NA,EAE,rat,Wistar,NA,6.5,Fampridine,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Fampridine was not the main focus of publication,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,rat,Marketed,NA

AIM: Aim of our work was to analyze proteomic profile in the homogenate of cerebral cortex in mice with EAE treated with cholekalciferol (D3). METHODS: In female C57/BL6 mice, EAE was induced by standard protocol using myeline oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG 35-55), pertussis toxin and complet Freund adjuvans. Mice were divided into three groups - controls (4), EAE (4) and EAE+D3 (4). Vitamin D3 was daily taken as 100 ng of cholecalciferol within 4 weeks. Animals were daily inspected, with the determination of EAE scores and weight. Animal cerebral cortexes were taken after human decapitation and prepared as homogenates. Proteins of homogenates were separated by the 2D PAGE electrophoresis and 14 of 200 identified spots were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry on MALDI-TOF/TOF by program PDQuest. RESULTS: We have identified statistically significant changes in the level of three proteins, which might be linked to the effect of vitamin D . In mice with EAE in comparison to controls we detected 5.7 times higher level of calmodulin 1 (calm1, p = 0,00013), 14.8 times lower level of fructose -bisphosphate aldolase C (AldoC, p = 0,003), and 6.9 times lower level of aldehyddehydrogenase 1 (Aldh1a7, p = 0,013). In mice with induced EAE and treated with vitamin D3 we detected 1.5 times lower level of Calm1 (p = 0,041), 3.8 times increased level of AldoC (p = 0,033) and 4.3 times lower level of Aldh1and7 (p = 0,034) compared to the naive EAE animals.

Natalizumab is thought to exert its therapeutic efficacy by blocking the alpha(4) integrin-mediated binding of circulating immune cells to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). As alpha(4) integrins control other immunological processes, natalizumab may, however, execute its beneficial effects elsewhere. By means of intravital microscopy we demonstrate that natalizumab specifically inhibits the firm adhesion but not the rolling or capture of human T cells on the inflamed BBB in mice with acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The efficiency of natalizumab to block T cell adhesion to the inflamed BBB was found to be more effective in EAE than in acute systemic TNF-alpha-induced inflammation.

Here we investigated the role of the crosstalk between sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and cytokine signaling cascades in astrocyte activation and inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration, and addressed the effects of fingolimod on astrocyte-neuron interaction and NO synthesis in vivo. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and confocal microscopy were used to detect S1P receptors, interleukin (IL) 1R, IL17RA, and nitrosative stress in multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) spinal cord, and the spinal cord of fingolimod-treated EAE mice. An in vitro model was established to study the effects of S1P, IL1, and IL17 stimulation on NFkB translocation and NO production in astrocytes, on spinal neuron survival, and on astrocyte-neuron interaction. Furthermore, fingolimod efficacy in blocking astrocyte-mediated neurodegeneration was evaluated. RESULTS: We found coordinated upregulation of IL1R, IL17RA, S1P1, and S1P3 together with nitrosative markers in astrocytes within MS and EAE lesions. In vitro studies revealed that S1P, IL17, and IL1 induced NF<ce><ba>B translocation and NO production in astrocytes, and astrocyte conditioned media triggered neuronal death. Importantly, fingolimod blocked the 2 activation events evoked in astrocytes by either S1P or inflammatory cytokines, resulting in inhibition of astrocyte-mediated neurodegeneration. Finally, therapeutic administration of fingolimod to EAE mice hampered astrocyte activation and NO production.

The costimulatory molecules B7-1 and B7-2 are ligands on antigen-presenting cells for the CD28 and CTLA-4 receptors on T cells. Previously, a fusion protein consisting of human CTLA-4 linked to human Fc was shown to bind B7-1 and B7-2 with high avidity and to prevent specific T cell activation. Here we investigated the effects of a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human CTLA-4 bound to mouse IgG2a Fc (CTLA-4-Fc) upon experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a T cell-mediated disease that serves as a model for multiple sclerosis. CTLA-4-Fc prevented experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in 26 of 28 CTLA-4-Fc-treated mice (median maximum score 0), whereas 28 of 30 mice treated with control mouse IgG2a developed disease (median maximum score 2.75). Less inflammation and virtually no demyelination or axonal loss occurred in CTLA-4-Fc-treated compared with control-treated mice. Activated splenocytes from CTLA-4-Fc-treated mice were able to transfer disease adoptively to naive recipients.

The role of T cell co-stimulation in ongoing EAE is less clear. In the present study, 32 mice with established EAE were randomly assigned to receive treatment with either CTLA-4-Fc or control Ig. Mice were followed daily by clinical scoring for 2 months post-immunization. A significant improvement in the degree of recovery following the acute episode and following relapses of EAE was observed in those mice randomized to CTLA-4-Fc treatment. Full clinical remission occurred twice as often in the CTLA-4-Fc group as in those mice receiving placebo, whereas placebo-treated mice were more likely to develop a stable prolonged neurologic deficit. Serial clinical scoring revealed no effect of CTLA-4-Fc upon relapse rate, with greater than 80% of the mice in each group displaying at least one clinical EAE relapse. In that the activation of memory T cells is relatively independent of T cell co-stimulation, these results indicate that development of chronic disease is associated with the activation of naive T cells and the recruitment of the latter cells into the disease process.

In contrast, the effector phases of EAE were relatively unaffected by similar treatments using MHC class II antigen (Ag)-specific mAb and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)4-Ig fusion proteins in some studies. This has been attributed to different sensitivities of effector cell function or the poor penetrance of inhibitory proteins into the central nervous system (CNS). To examine this question further, MHC class II Ag-specific mAb and CTLA4-Ig were delivered directly into the CNS following EAE induction, and both were found to inhibit disease. While it was found that systemic administration of mouse CTLA4-Ig could also inhibit the progression of effector immune responses when administered shortly before or during clinical disease, these were significantly more active when delivered directly into the CNS, which probably involved an action on both CD28 ligands, CD80 and CD86. Although mouse CTLA4-human Ig was therapeutically less efficient than mouse CTLA4-mouse Ig protein, probably due to the enhanced immunogenicity and lower functional activity, gene delivery of CTLA4-human Ig into the CNS using a non-replicating adenoviral vector was more effective than a single injection of CTLA4-human Ig protein.

Long-chain lipophilic amino alcohols with immunoregulatory activities have already been studied in some models of inflammatory diseases, but the action of these compounds in EAE and MS is still unknown. In this study, we investigated whether the lipophilic amino alcohol 4b would act to improve the clinical signs of EAE and reduce the demyelination process and the neuroinflammatory parameters in the spinal cord, as well as the inflammatory process in the inguinal lymph nodes, of C57Bl/6 mice induced with EAE after stimulation with MOG(35-55) and pertussis toxin.

Cyclotides are small plant proteins with a wide range of biological activity, making them a target for researchers to investigate. This study was conducted to investigate the possible effects of cyclotide-rich fractions from Viola odorata as an immunomodulatory agent in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. METHODS: At room temperature, the plant materials were subjected to maceration in methanol: dichloromethane (1:1; v/v) for 3 days. The extraction was repeated 3 times, and the final concentrated extract was partitioned 3 times by 1/2 volume of double-distilled water. The aqueous phases were separated and freeze-dried. Finally, the crude extract was fractionated by C18 silicagel using vacuum liquid chromatography, with mobile phases of 30%, 50% and 80% of ethanol: water, respectively. The 50%, and 80% fractions were analyzed by HPLC and MALDI-TOF analysis and administrated intraperitoneally to forty-five female C57BL/6 EAE-induced mice, at 5, 25, and 50 mg/kg doses. After 28 days, the animals were evaluated using EAE clinical scoring which was done every 3 days, cytokine levels, and myelination level. RESULTS: The results confirmed the presence of cyclotides in V. odorata based on their retention time and the composition of mobile phase in HPLC and the molecular weight of the peaks in MALDI-TOF analysis. It was observed that cyclotides, especially in the 80% fraction group at the dose of 50 mg/kg significantly reduced the clinical scores, inflammation, and demyelination in EAE mice compared with the normal saline group (P<0.05), and the results of this group were comparable with fingolimod (P>0.05).

MS therapy is based on immunomodulatory drugs that reduce disease recurrence and severity. Vitamin D is a hormone whose immunomodulatory ability has been widely demonstrated, including in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is an animal model of CNS inflammation. In this study, we evaluated the potential of very early intervention with the active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) to control neuroinflammation during EAE development. EAE was induced in C57BL/6J mice and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 administration began 1 day after disease induction. This procedure decreased prevalence, clinical score, inflammation, and demyelination. It also reduced MHCII expression in macrophages and microglia as well as the level of oxidative stress and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression for NLRP3, caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-1<ce><b2>, CX(3)CR1, CCL17, RORc and Tbx21 at the CNS. Otherwise, mRNA expression for ZO-1 increased at the lumbar spinal cord. These effects were accompanied by the stabilization of blood-spinal cord barrier permeability.

In vivo administration of fingolimod during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was established to verify the activation state of splenic, CNS infiltrating, and CNS resident myeloid cells ex vivo at flow cytometer.

METHODS: Mouse MRI was used to investigate remyelination in the cuprizone model. We then used a conditional demyelination Xenopus laevis model to assess the dose-response of siponimod on remyelination. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis-optic neuritis (EAEON) in C57Bl/6J mice, we monitored the retinal thickness and the visual acuity using optical coherence tomography and optomotor response. Optic nerve inflammatory infiltrates, demyelination, and microglial and oligodendroglial differentiation were assessed by immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR, and bulk RNA sequencing. RESULTS: An increased remyelination was observed in the cuprizone model. Siponimod treatment of demyelinated tadpoles improved remyelination in comparison to control in a bell-shaped dose-response curve. Siponimod in the EAEON model attenuated the clinical score, reduced the retinal degeneration, and improved the visual function after prophylactic and therapeutic treatment, also in a bell-shaped manner. Inflammatory infiltrates and demyelination of the optic nerve were reduced, the latter even after therapeutic treatment, which also shifted microglial differentiation to a promyelinating phenotype.

The presumed mode of action is via blockade of axonal voltage gated potassium channels, thereby enhancing conduction in demyelinated axons. In this study, we provide evidence that in addition to those symptomatic effects, 4-AP can prevent neuroaxonal loss in the CNS. Using in vivo optical coherence tomography imaging, visual function testing and histologic assessment, we observed a reduction in retinal neurodegeneration with 4-AP in models of experimental optic neuritis and optic nerve crush. These effects were not related to an anti-inflammatory mode of action or a direct impact on retinal ganglion cells. Rather, histology and in vitro experiments indicated 4-AP stabilization of myelin and oligodendrocyte precursor cells associated with increased nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells. In experimental optic neuritis, 4-AP potentiated the effects of immunomodulatory treatment with fingolimod. As extended release 4-AP is already licensed for symptomatic multiple sclerosis treatment, we performed a retrospective, multicentre optical coherence tomography study to longitudinally compare retinal neurodegeneration between 52 patients on continuous 4-AP therapy and 51 matched controls. In line with the experimental data, during concurrent 4-AP therapy, degeneration of the macular retinal nerve fibre layer was reduced over 2 years.

Disease-modifying agents slow down the progression of multiple sclerosis and prevent relapses, yet it remains unclear if they yield analgesia. We explored the analgesic potential of fingolimod (FTY720), an agonist and/or functional antagonist at the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), because it reduces hyperalgesia in models of peripheral inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We used a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35 to 55 (MOG35-55) mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, modified to avoid frank paralysis, and thus, allow for assessment of withdrawal behaviors to somatosensory stimuli. Daily intraperitoneal fingolimod reduced behavioral signs of central neuropathic pain (mechanical and cold hypersensitivity) in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. Both autoimmune encephalomyelitis and fingolimod changed hyperalgesia before modifying motor function, suggesting that pain-related effects and clinical neurological deficits were modulated independently. Fingolimod also reduced cellular markers of central sensitization of neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord: glutamate-evoked Ca signaling and stimulus-evoked phospho-extracellular signal-related kinase ERK (pERK) expression, as well as upregulation of astrocytes (GFAP) and macrophage/microglia (Iba1) immunoreactivity. The antihyperalgesic effects of fingolimod were prevented or reversed by the S1PR1 antagonist W146 (1 mg/kg daily, i.p.) and could be mimicked by either repeated or single injection of the S1PR1-selective agonist SEW2871. Fingolimod did not change spinal membrane S1PR1 content, arguing against a functional antagonist mechanism.

Blockade of this enzyme by atorvastatin (AT) inhibits the destructive proinflammatory T helper cell (Th)1 response during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. Here we present evidence linking specific isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway to signaling pathways that regulate T cell autoimmunity. We demonstrate that the isoprenoid geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP) mediates proliferation, whereas both GGPP and its precursor, farnesyl-PP, regulate the Th1 differentiation of myelin-reactive T cells. Depletion of these isoprenoid intermediates in vivo via oral AT administration hindered these T cell responses by decreasing geranylgeranylated RhoA and farnesylated Ras at the plasma membrane. This was associated with reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 phosphorylation and DNA binding of their cotarget c-fos in response to T cell receptor activation.

CD28 engagement results in T cell activation, differentiation and survival while CTLA-4 signals block IL-2 production, cell cycle progression and T cell differentiation. We explored the role of CTLA-4 in peripheral tolerance induced by intravenous administration of ethylene carbodiimide-fixed, antigen-coupled splenocytes in the PLP139 - 151-induced relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis system. Tolerance induction with PLP139 - 151-coupled splenocytes correlates with low B7 expression on the fixed antigen-presenting cells, conditions that would favor CTLA-4-mediated inhibition. Administration of CTLA-4Ig or anti-CTLA-4 concomitant with the 'tolerogenic' stimulus, however, failed to reverse tolerance induction. In contrast, blocking CTLA-4 at the time of secondary 'immunogenic' encounter with antigen reversed the tolerant state. These findings indicate that CTLA-4 is required to maintain the unresponsive state of the tolerized T cells upon antigenic stimulation under inflammatory conditions and, therefore, have important implications for therapeutic regulation of autoimmune disease.",10.1002/1521-4141(200204)32:4<972::Aid-immu972>3.0.Co;2-m,no,NA,IEB,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SJL,female,6.5,Abatacept,control,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,drug name in publication: CTLA-4Ig (--> according to our list synonym of Abatacept),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Failed,NA

Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction was evident by leakage of the tracer sodium fluorescein, along with reduced expression of claudin-5 by endothelial cells and desmin by pericytes. Immunohistological and ultrastructural analyses revealed detachment of the astroglial cell bodies from the blood vessels and loss of their connections with both the blood vessels and the neuronal synapses. Furthermore, examination of individual astrocytic processes at cortical layer IV, where well-defined neuronal columns (barrels) are linked to functional properties, revealed loss of astrocytic confinement to the functional neuronal boundaries. Thus, in contrast to the highly modulated patches of astrocyte processes in na<c3><af>ve mice overlapping the barrel cores, in EAE-mice process distribution was uniform ignoring the barrel boundaries. These aberrations are attributed to the surrounding inflammation, indicated by T-cells presence in the cortex as well as in the subcortical white matter and the meninges. Immunomodulatory treatment with glatiramer acetate partially abrogated the neurovascular damage. These combined findings indicate that under inflammatory conditions, activated perivascular astrocytes fail in neuro-hemodynamic coupling, resulting in obstructed cross-talk between the blood vessels and the neurons.

A number of ion channels have been implicated in the progression of MS, most notably in cell types involved in the immune response. In the present study, we investigated the implication of two ion channel isoforms, Kv1.1 and Kv1.3, in experimental models of neuroinflammation and demyelination. Immunohistochemical staining of brain sections from the mouse cuprizone model displayed high levels Kv1.3 expression. In an astroglial cellular model of inflammation, stimulation with LPS resulted also in a higher expression of Kv1.1 and Kv1.3, while the introduction of 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) exacerbated the release of pro-inflammatory chemokine CXCL10. In the oligodendroglial cellular model of demyelination, the alteration in expression levels of Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 may be correlated with that of MBP levels. Indirect co-culture was attempted to further understand the communication between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, The addition of reactive astrocytes<e2><80><99> secretome significantly inhibited the production of MBP, this inhibition was accompanied by an alteration in the expression of Kv1.1 and Kv1.3. The addition of 4-AP in this case did not alleviate the decrease in MBP production. In conclusion, the use of 4-AP generated controversial results, suggesting 4-AP may be used in the early stages of the disease or in the remission phases to stimulate myelination, yet in induced toxic inflammatory environment, 4-AP exacerbated this effect.",10.1016/j.bbrc.2023.02.066,no,NA,IEB,1,NA,cuprizone,mouse,C57BL/6,female,NA,Fampridine,control,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

CD52 blockade also had a significant effect on microglial morphology in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures but did not affect microglial functions. Furthermore, anti-CD52 neither changed baseline neuronal calcium, nor did it act neuroprotective in excitotoxicity models.

We found that memory CD4+ T cells up-regulated the activation marker CD44 as well as CXCR3 and ICOS, proliferated more and produced more interferon-<ce><b3> and less interleukin-17 compared to effector T cells. Moreover, adoptive transfer of memory T cells into T cell receptor (TCR)<ce><b1><ce><b2>-/- recipients induced more severe disease than did effector CD4+ T cells with marked central nervous system inflammation and axonal damage. The uniqueness of disease mediated by memory T cells was confirmed by the differential susceptibility to immunomodulatory therapies in vivo. CD28-B7 T cell costimulatory signal blockade by CTLA4Ig suppressed effector cell-mediated EAE but had minimal effects on disease induced by memory cells. In contrast, ICOS-B7h blockade exacerbated effector T cell-induced EAE but protected from disease induced by memory T cells. However, blockade of the OX40 (CD134) costimulatory pathway ameliorated disease mediated by both memory and effector T cells.

In this study, we measured gene expression in mouse spinal cord during myelin oligodendrocyte gp35-55 peptide-induced EAE, using quantitative RT-PCR, to identify gene markers that monitor individual hallmark pathological processes. We defined a small panel of genes whose longitudinal expression patterns provided insight into the timing, interrelationships, and mechanisms of individual disease processes and the efficacy of therapeutics for the treatment of MS. Earliest transcriptional changes were upregulation of Il17a and sharp downregulation of neuronal and oligodendrocyte marker genes preceding clinical disease onset, whereas neuroinflammatory markers progressively increased as symptoms and tissue lesions developed. EAE-induced gene-expression changes were not altered in mice deficient in IKK<ce><b2> in cells of the myeloid lineage compared with controls, but the administration of a selective inhibitor of soluble TNF to mice from the day of immunization delayed changes in the expression of innate inflammation, myelin, and neuron markers from the presymptomatic phase.

Prophylactic treatment of mice with glatiramer acetate normalized gene marker expression, and this correlated with the level of therapeutic success.

METHODS: Medications were evaluated in culture and in mice with acute and chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). RESULTS: Both medications individually reduced iron neurotoxicity and a combination effect was not observed. Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was manifested by minocycline only. Minocycline reduced T-cell proliferation more prominently than hydroxychloroquine; an aggregate effect occurred at low but not high concentrations. B-cell proliferation was mitigated to a greater extent by hydroxychloroquine and an additive effect was not evident. In EAE, suboptimal doses of minocycline and hydroxychloroquine individually delayed onset of clinical signs, while their combination suppressed clinical manifestations until treatment was stopped.

METHODS: We treated monophasic experimental autoimmune EAE, induced in Lewis rat, with vitamin D3 and adoptively transfer tolerogenic bone marrow-derived DCs generated in the presence of vitamin D3. RESULTS: This study provides evidence that the in vivo administration of vitamin D3, as well as the adoptive transfer of vitamin D3 -induced IDO(+) immature/tolerogenic dendritic cells, leads to a significant increase in the percentage of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in the lymph nodes in a rat model of MS, experimental autoimmune EAE. Concomitant with the increase in this cell population, there is a significant decrease in the number of autoreactive T cells in the central nervous system. Bone marrow-derived DCs cultivated in the presence of vitamin D3 present a tolerogenic profile with high IL-10, TNF<ce><b1>, and IDO expression and decreased MHC-II and CD80 expression. The adoptive transfer of IDO (+) DCs induces a significant increase in the percentage of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) T cells in the lymph nodes, comparable with vitamin D3 treatment.

Two of the most intriguing findings are the season of birth and childhood sun exposure effects. They both suggest that a vitamin D deficiency during these critical imprinting periods is a risk factor for MS. After having confirmed that people born in November are at lower risk of developing MS, we devised a mouse model of prenatal vitamin D deficiency. We observed that adult offspring born to vitamin D deficient mothers, when compared to control offspring, developed a striking milder and delayed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and permanently overexpressed the vitamin D receptor. This unexpected finding led us to conjecture that the newborns, after having known an in utero vitamin D-deficient environment, were highly sensitive ex utero to cholecalciferol-containing diet and interpreted the postnatal food as a vitamin D enriched environment. To validate this hypothesis, we devised a mouse model of postnatal vitamin D supplementation. Interestingly, using the same EAE model, we demonstrated that a delayed onset and less severe symptoms were displayed by postnatally vitamin D-supplemented mice.

In this study we sought to translate some of our previous findings in murine systems to human in vitro models and delineate the interdependence of these different cytokines in their immunoregulatory effects. We demonstrate that human IL-27 upregulates IL-10 in T cell-activated PBMC cultures and that IFN-<ce><b2> drives IL-27 production in activated monocytes. IFN-<ce><b2>-driven IL-27 is responsible for the upregulation of IL-10, but not IL-17 suppression, by IFN-<ce><b2> in human PBMCs. Surprisingly, IL-10 is not required for the suppression of IL-17 by either IL-27 or IFN-<ce><b2> in this model or in de novo differentiating Th17 cells, nor is IL-27 signaling required for the suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by IFN-<ce><b2> in vivo. Furthermore, and even more surprisingly, IL-10 is not required for the suppression of Th17-biased EAE by IL-27, in sharp contrast to Th1-biased EAE. In conclusion, IFN-<ce><b2> and IL-27 both induce human IL-10, both suppress human Th17 responses, and both suppress murine EAE. However, IL-27 signaling is not required for the therapeutic effect of IFN-<ce><b2> in EAE. Suppression of Th17-biased EAE by IL-27 is IL-10-independent, in contrast to its mechanism of action in Th1-biased EAE. Taken together, these findings delineate a complex set of interdependent and independent immunoregulatory mechanisms of IFN-<ce><b2>, IL-27, and IL-10 in human experimental models and in murine Th1- and Th17-driven autoimmunity.

The drug is phosphorylated in vivo by sphingosine kinase 2 to its bioactive form, FTY720-P. Although treatment with FTY720 is accompanied by a reduction of the peripheral lymphocyte count, its efficacy in MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) may be due to additional, direct effects in the central nervous system (CNS). We now show that FTY720 localizes to the CNS white matter, preferentially along myelin sheaths. Brain trough levels of FTY720 and FTY720-P in rat EAE are of the same magnitude and dose dependently increase; they are in the range of 40 to 540 ng/g in the brain tissue at efficacious doses and exceed blood concentrations severalfold.

FTY720 effectiveness is likely due to a culmination of mechanisms involving reduction of autoreactive T cells, neuroprotective influence of FTY720-P in the CNS, and inhibition of inflammatory mediators in the brain.",10.1124/jpet.107.127183,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Dark Agouti,female,NA,Fingolimod,control,1,110,"1,2",0.1,33,0.1,2.7,48,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,rat,Marketed,NA

To further investigate its mode of action, we analyzed gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS) during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). FTY720 downregulated inflammatory genes in addition to vascular adhesion molecules. It decreased the matrix metalloproteinase gene MMP-9 and increased its counterregulator--tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, TIMP-1--resulting in a proteolytic balance that favors preservation of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity. Furthermore, FTY720 reduced S1P lyase that increases the S1P concentration in the brain, in line with a marked reversal of neurological deficits and raising the possibility for enhanced triggering of S1P receptors on resident brain cells. This is accompanied by an increase in S1P(1) and S1P(5) in contrast with the attenuation of S1P(3) and S1P(4). Late-stage rescue therapy with FTY720, even up to 1 month after EAE onset, reversed BBB leakiness and reduced demyelination, along with normalization of neurologic function. Our results indicate rapid blockade of ongoing disease processes by FTY720, and structural restoration of the CNS parenchyma, which is likely caused by the inhibition of autoimmune T cell infiltration and direct modulation of microvascular and/or glial cells.",10.1111/j.1750-3639.2008.00182.x,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Dark Agouti,female,9,Fingolimod,control,1,NA,"1,2",0,6,0,2.6,6,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,rat,Marketed,NA

We investigated the efficacy and mechanism of immunosuppression against EAE by administering 2-amino-[2-(4-octylphenyl) ethyl]-1,3-propanediol hydrochloride (FTY720) in Lewis rats immunized with myelin basic protein together with complete Freund's adjuvant. FTY720 treatment almost completely protected the rats against disease. The protection by FTY720 was associated with a dramatic reduction in the number of lymphocytes staining for T-cell receptors in the spinal cord as examined by immunohistochemistry. The mRNA expression of Th1 cytokines interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, and interferon-gamma in the spinal cord was also reduced dramatically as assessed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, lymphocytes isolated from the spleen of FTY720-treated rats were transferred into naive recipient rats against EAE manifestation by reducing both disease incidence and clinical score. These results suggested that the protective anti-inflammatory effect of treatment with FTY720 was, to a large extent, due to the inhibition of encephalitogenic T-cell responses and/or their migration into the central nervous system and may be a potential candidate for use in treating patients with MS.",10.1124/jpet.102.045658,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,male,10,Fingolimod,control,1,51,1,0,23,0,2.9,16,0.6,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,rat,Marketed,NA

Pharmacological modulation of voltage-sensitive potassium channels (K(V)) has been found to improve conduction in experimentally induced demyelination and produces symptomatic improvement in MS patients. Here we used an animal model of autoimmune inflammatory neurodegeneration, namely experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), to test the influence of the K(V)-inhibitor 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) on various disease and immune parameters as well as mobility in MOG<e2><82><83><e2><82><85><e2><82><8b><e2><82><85><e2><82><85> immunized C57Bl/6 mice.

Neither prophylactic nor therapeutic treatment with 4-AP altered disease incidence or disease course of EAE. Histopathological signs of demyelination and neuronal damage as well as MRI imaging of brain volume changes were unaltered. While application of 4-AP significantly reduced the standing outward current of stimulated CD4(+) T cells compared to controls, it failed to impact intracellular calcium concentrations in these cells. Compatibly, KV channel inhibition neither influenced CD4(+) T cell effector functions (proliferation, IL17 or IFN<ce><b3> production).

Hence, this relates to replacement of lost oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths-the primary targets of autoimmune attacks. Endogenous remyelination is mainly mediated via activation and differentiation of resident oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPCs), whereas its efficiency remains limited and declines with disease progression and aging. Teriflunomide has been approved as a first-line treatment for relapsing remitting MS. Beyond its role in acting via inhibition of de novo pyrimidine synthesis leading to a cytostatic effect on proliferating lymphocyte subsets, this study aims to uncover its potential to foster myelin repair. METHODS: Within the cuprizone mediated de-/remyelination model teriflunomide dependent effects on oligodendroglial homeostasis and maturation, related to cellular processes important for myelin repair were analyzed in vivo. Teriflunomide administration was performed either as pulse or continuously and markers specific for oligodendroglial maturation and mitochondrial integrity were examined by means of gene expression and immunohistochemical analyses. In addition, axon myelination was determined using electron microscopy. RESULTS: Both pulse and constant teriflunomide treatment efficiently boosted myelin repair activities in this model, leading to accelerated generation of oligodendrocytes and restoration of myelin sheaths. Moreover, teriflunomide restored mitochondrial integrity within oligodendroglial cells. CONCLUSIONS: The link between de novo pyrimidine synthesis inhibition, oligodendroglial rescue, and maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis appears as a key for successful myelin repair and hence for protection of axons from degeneration.",10.1186/s12974-022-02686-6,no,NA,PH,1,NA,cuprizone,mouse,C57BL/6,female,8,Teriflunomide,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

As both estradiol (E2) and progesterone exert neuroprotective and myelinating effects on the nervous system, the effects of sex steroids were studied in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. Methods: EAE was induced in female C57BL/6 mice by administration of a myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG40-45) peptide. Clinical signs of EAE, myelin protein expression and neuronal parameters were determined in mice with or without hormonal treatment. Results: Progesterone given prior to EAE induction attenuated the clinical scores of the disease, slightly delayed disease onset and decreased demyelination foci, according to luxol fast blue staining (LFB), myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP) and mRNA expression. Motoneuron expression of Na,K-ATPase mRNA was also enhanced by progesterone. In turn, combined E2 plus progesterone therapy more effectively prevented neurological deficits, fully restored LFB staining, MBP and PLP immunoreactivity and avoided inflammatory cell infiltration. On the neuronal side, steroid biotherapy increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA. Conclusion: Early treatment with progesterone alone or more evidently in combination with E2 showed a clinical benefit and produced myelinating and neuroprotective effects in mice with MOG 40-45-induced EAE.

The investigation of iNOS expression during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) of the Lewis rat demonstrated iNOS immunoreactivity and mRNA both during inflammatory bursts (days 12 and 23 post-immunization) and during the remission phase (day 18). iNOS expression was region-specific and expanded with time along a caudo-rostral axis, thus, correlating with the development of inflammatory infiltrates. Whereas cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage continuously contributed to iNOS expression, astrocytes only expressed iNOS immunoreactivity or mRNA during the relapse (day 23). In order to investigate possible regulatory effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3) on iNOS expression, rats were treated with the hormone after the beginning of clinical signs (days 11, 13, 19, 21 and 23 post-immunization), and areas of the CNS were examined at day 23. 1,25-D3 exerted a drastic inhibitory effect on iNOS expression, both at the protein and the mRNA levels. However, this effect was region-specific, and was most pronounced in the cerebellum and brainstem, but non-existent in cerebral cortex. iNOS down-regulation occurred in macrophages, activated microglia and astrocytes. The inhibition of iNOS expression in some CNS structures could account for the improvement of clinical signs observed in EAE-rats treated with 1,25-D3. Since 1,25-D3 can be synthesized by activated macrophages or microglia, our results support the hypothesis that this hormone might be implicated in the control of the CNS-specific immune responses. 1,25-D3 or its analogues could, thus, be of therapeutic value in the management of iNOS-associated diseases of the CNS.",10.1016/S0169-328X(96)00260-4,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,female,8.5,Vitamin D3,control,1,37,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,rat,Failed,NA

In an acute mouse model of autoimmune retinal disease, we demonstrate that treatment with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, suppresses clinical ocular pathology, retinal vascular leakage, and leukocytic infiltration into the retina. Efficacy was reversed by coadministration of mevalonolactone, the downstream product of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, but not by squalene, which is distal to isoprenoid pyrophosphate metabolites within the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Lovastatin treatment (20 mg/kg/day i.p.) over 7 days, which resulted in plasma lovastatin hydroxyacid concentrations of 0.098 <c2><b1> 0.03 <ce><bc>M, did not induce splenocyte Th2 cytokine production but did cause a small reduction in Ag-induced T cell proliferation and a decrease in the production of IFN-<ce><b3> and IL-10. Thus, it is possible to dissociate the therapeutic effect of statins in experimental autoimmune uveitic mice from their activity on the Th1/Th2 balance. Statins inhibit isoprenoid pyrophosphate synthesis, precursors required for the prenylation and posttranslational activation of Rho GTPase, a key molecule in the endothelial ICAM-1-mediated pathway that facilitates lymphocyte migration. Consistent with inhibition of leukocyte infiltration in vivo, lovastatin treatment of retinal endothelial cell monolayers in vitro leads to inhibition of lymphocyte transmigration, which may, in part, account for drug efficacy. Unlike lovastatin, atorvastatin treatment showed little efficacy in retinal inflammatory disease despite showing significant clinical benefit in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

This synaptopathy is characterized by an imbalance between glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission and has been proposed to be a potential therapeutic target. Siponimod (BAF312), a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate1,5 receptor modulator, is currently under investigation in a clinical trial in secondary progressive MS patients. We investigated whether siponimod, in addition to its peripheral immune modulation, may exert direct neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice with chronic progressive EAE. METHODS: Minipumps allowing continuous intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of siponimod for 4<c2><a0>weeks were implanted into C57BL/6 mice subjected to MOG35-55-induced EAE. Electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, western blot, qPCR experiments, and peripheral lymphocyte counts were performed. In addition, the effect of siponimod on activated microglia was assessed in vitro to confirm the direct effect of the drug on CNS-resident immune cells. RESULTS: Siponimod administration (0.45<c2><a0><ce><bc>g/day) induced a significant beneficial effect on EAE clinical scores with minimal effect on peripheral lymphocyte counts. Siponimod rescued defective GABAergic transmission in the striatum of EAE, without correcting the EAE-induced alterations of glutamatergic transmission. We observed a significant attenuation of astrogliosis and microgliosis together with reduced lymphocyte infiltration in the striatum of EAE mice treated with siponimod. Interestingly, siponimod reduced the release of IL-6 and RANTES from activated microglial cells in vitro, which might explain the reduced lymphocyte infiltration. Furthermore, the loss of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) GABAergic interneurons typical of EAE brains was rescued by siponimod treatment, providing a plausible explanation of the selective effects of this drug on inhibitory synaptic transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our results show that siponimod has neuroprotective effects in the CNS of EAE mice, which are likely independent of its peripheral immune effect, suggesting that this drug could be effective in limiting neurodegenerative pathological processes in MS.",10.1186/s12974-016-0686-4,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,NA,NA,Siponimod,control,1,NA,0,0,6,0,2.3,9,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

Glatiramer acetate (GA) is an immunomodulatory agent used in MS treatment with potential neuroprotective action. Aim of the present study was to investigate whether GA has effects on glutamate transmission alterations occurring in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), to disclose a possible mechanism of GA-induced neuroprotection in this mouse model of MS. Single neuron electrophysiological recordings and immunofluorescence analysis of microglia activation were performed in the striatum of EAE mice, treated or not with GA, at different stages of the disease. GA treatment was able to reverse the tumor necrosis factor-<ce><b1> (TNF-<ce><b1>)-induced alterations of striatal glutamate-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) of EAE mice. Incubation of striatal slices of control animals with lymphocytes taken from EAE mice treated with GA failed to replicate such an anti-glutamatergic effect, while activated microglial cells stimulated with GA in vitro mimicked the effect of GA treatment of EAE mice. Consistently, EAE mice treated with GA had less microglial activation and less TNF-<ce><b1> expression than untreated EAE animals. Furthermore, direct application of GA to EAE slices replicated the in vivo protective activity of GA.

S1P1 receptors are essential for lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes and a drug target in immune-mediated diseases. Here, we have characterized the immunomodulatory potential of BAF312 and the S1P receptor-mediated effects on heart rate using preclinical and human data. Experimental approach: BAF312 was tested in a rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Electrophysiological recordings of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels were carried out in human atrial myocytes. A Phase I multiple-dose trial studied the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of BAF312 in 48 healthy subjects. KEY RESULTS BAF312 effectively suppressed EAE in rats by internalizing S1P 1 receptors, rendering them insensitive to the egress signal from lymph nodes. In healthy volunteers, BAF312 caused preferential decreases in CD4+ T cells, Tna<c3><af>ve, Tcentral memory and B cells within 4-6 h. Cell counts returned to normal ranges within a week after stopping treatment, in line with the elimination half-life of BAF312. Despite sparing S1P3 receptors (associated with bradycardia in mice), BAF312 induced rapid, transient (day 1 only) bradycardia in humans. BAF312-mediated activation of GIRK channels in human atrial myocytes can fully explain the bradycardia. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS This study illustrates species-specific differences in S1P receptor specificity for first-dose cardiac effects.

The lipophilicity and low molecular weight of FTY720 allows it to cross blood brain barrier (BBB) and exert both peripheral and central effects. Previous reports showed that intranasal (IN) administration of drugs are the preferred non-invasive route, which bypasses BBB and improves their delivery and bioavailability in the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, we aimed to compare the effects of IN and oral administrations of FTY720 on astrocyte activation and demyelination levels of optic chiasm in a focal demyelination model. METHODS: The experimental model was induced by injection of 2 <c2><b5>L lysolecithin 1% into the optic chiasm of male Wistar rats. The rats were treated by oral gavage or intranasal drop of FTY720 at dose of 0.3<c2><a0>mg/kg for 14 days. Astrocyte activation was analyzed using GFAP immunostaining, extent of demyelination, and myelination levels were measured by fluoromyelin staining, and MOG immunostaining, respectively. Then, the concentration of FTY720 was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method in brain tissues. RESULTS: Our data showed that IN administration of FTY720 significantly decreases astrocyte activation and demyelination levels in the optic chiasm compared to the oral administration route. In addition, the concentration of FTY720 was higher in the brain tissue of IN receiving rats compared to the oral treated group. CONCLUSION: It seems that IN administration of FTY720 may be a preferred route to decline the central inflammation and demyelination levels in the MS patients.",10.1016/j.msard.2022.103518,no,NA,PH,1,NA,lysolecithin,rat,Wistar,male,NA,Fingolimod,control,1,30,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,rat,Marketed,NA

We assessed the effects of the treatment on central nervous system (CNS) viral load, intrathecal immune response, and progressive neurological disability in mice intracranially infected with TMEV. In the TMEV-IDD model, we showed that teriflunomide has both anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, but there seemed to be no impact on disability progression and intrathecal antibody production. Notably, benefits in TMEV-IDD were mostly mediated by effects on various cytokines produced in the CNS.

Markers of CNS infiltration were assessed using MRI in patients and immunohistochemistry in mice. Supernatants from PBMCs obtained during estriol treatment in female MS patients showed significantly decreased MMP-9 compared with pretreatment. Decreases in MMP-9 coincided with a decrease in enhancing lesion volume on MRI. Estriol treatment of mice with EAE reduced MMP-9 in supernatants from autoantigen-stimulated splenocytes, coinciding with decreased CNS infiltration by T cells and monocytes.

This study aims to analyze neurogenesis in a model of toxic demyelination in order to evaluate the effects of VitD on demyelination and remyelination. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used 24 male Wistar rats that had received surgical lesions to the corpus callosum and were injected with lysolecithin. Rats were divided into three groups: Group 1 included eight rats with lesions to the corpus callosum but not lysolecithin injections (sham group), group 2 included eight rats with lesions to the corpus callosum that were injected with lysolecithin (lysolecithin group), and group 3 included eight rats with lesions that were injected with lysolecithin and received VitD (VitD group). We analyzed neurogenesis both in the subventricular zone and at the lesion site. RESULTS: Administration of VitD promotes the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and the migration of these cells to the lesion site in the corpus callosum; these cells subsequently differentiate into oligodendrocyte lineage cells and produce myelin basic protein. This phenomenon was not caused by microglial activation, which was less marked in rats receiving VitD. Megalin expression did not increase at the lesion site, which suggests that VitD is internalized by other mechanisms.

Using daily treatment with 10 mg/kg 2-(4-(5-(3,4-diethoxyphenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-yl amino)ethanol (CYM-5442) at the onset of clinical signs in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein MOG(35-55)- induced experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), we assessed clinical scores, CNS cellular infiltration, demyelination, and gliosis for 12 days with CYM-5442, vehicle, or fingolimod. CYM-5442 levels in CNS and plasma were determined at experiment termination, and blood lymphopenia was measured 3 and 24 h after the last injection. Plasma levels of cytokines were assayed at the end of the protocol. Changes in S1P(1)-enhanced green fluorescent protein expression on neurons and astrocytes during active EAE and upon CYM-5442 treatment were quantified with flow cytometry and Western blotting by using native-locus enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged S1P(1) mice. S1P(1) agonism alone reduced pathological features as did fingolimod (maximally lymphopenic throughout), despite full reversal of lymphopenia within each dosing interval. CYM-5442 levels in CNS but not in plasma were sustained. Neuronal and astrocytic S1P(1) expression in EAE was suppressed by CYM-5442 treatment, relative to vehicle, and levels of key cytokines, such as interleukin 17A, were also significantly reduced in drug-treated mice. S1P(1)-selective agonists that induce reversible lymphopenia while persisting in the CNS may be effective MS treatments.",10.1124/mol.111.076109,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Fingolimod,control,3,NA,2,0.9,6,0.4,2.3,6,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,drug leads to a reversible lymphopenia,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

Antioxidant vitamins D and E are suggested for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases like MS, while their mechanisms of action are not well understood. Here, we have tried to study the effects of these vitamins on demyelination, cell death, and remyelination of rat hippocampus following local ethidium bromide (EB) injection. Animals received 100 mg/kg vitamin E or 5 microg/kg of vitamin D3 for 2, 7, or 28 days. The extent of demyelination, myelin staining intensity, and expression of myelin basic protein and caspase-3 were investigated using histological and immunoblotting verification. Administration of EB alone caused demyelination, cell death, and afterward an endogenous repair. Vitamins E and D3 reduced the EB-induced damage and increased the endogenous remyelination of hippocampus. Although the anti-apoptotic effect of these vitamins and protection against demyelination were predictable based on their antioxidant effect, our results indicated the positive effect of vitamins E and D3 on process of remyelination by endogenous progenitor cells and supported their possible therapeutic effects in the context of demyelinating diseases like MS.",10.1007/s10571-009-9451-x,no,NA,PH,1,NA,ethidium bromide,rat,Sprague-Dawley,male,NA,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,age=adult,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,rat,Failed,NA

Across a range of experimental models, LINGO-1 has been found to inhibit neuron and oligodendrocyte survival, axon regeneration, and (re)myelination. The therapeutic effects of anti-LINGO-1 antibodies on optic nerve axonal loss and regeneration have not yet been investigated. OBJECTIVE: In this series of studies we investigate if LINGO-1 antibodies can prevent acute inflammatory axonal loss, and promote axonal regeneration after injury in rodent optic nerves. METHODS: The effects of anti-LINGO-1 antibody on optic nerve axonal damage were assessed using rodent myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and its effects on axonal regeneration were assessed in optic nerve crush injury models. RESULTS: In the optic nerve, anti-LINGO-1 antibody therapy was associated with improved optic nerve parallel diffusivity measures on MRI in mice with EAE and reduced axonal loss in rat EAE. Both anti-LINGO-1 antibody therapy and the genetic deletion of LINGO-1 reduced nerve crush-induced axonal degeneration and enhanced axonal regeneration.

MS risk is associated with vitamin D deficiency, and its bioactive form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], has been shown to prevent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of MS, via an incompletely understood mechanism. Herein, we systematically examined 1,25(OH)2D3 effects on TH cells during their migration from the lymph nodes to the CNS. Our data demonstrate that myelin-reactive TH cells are successfully generated in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3, secrete proinflammatory cytokines, and do not preferentially differentiate into suppressor T cells. These cells are able to leave the lymph node, enter the peripheral circulation, and migrate to the s.c. immunization sites. However, TH cells from 1,25(OH)2D3-treated mice are unable to enter the CNS parenchyma but are instead maintained in the periphery.

Here, we identify an in vivo astrocyte subpopulation termed immediate-early astrocytes (ieAstrocytes) that is defined by functional c-Fos activation during CNS disease development. An unbiased screen for CNS cells showing c-Fos activation during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), was developed by using inducible, TetTag c-Fos reporter mice that label activated cells with a temporally stable, nuclear green fluorescent protein (GFP). Four-dimensional (3D over time) c-Fos activation maps in the spinal cord were produced by combining tissue clearing (iDISCO) and confocal microscopy that identified onset and expansion of GFP(+) cell populations during EAE. More than 95% of the GFP(+) cells showed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity-in contrast to absent or rare labeling of neurons, microglia, and infiltrating immune cells-which constituted ieAstrocytes that linearly increased in number with progression of EAE. ieAstrocyte formation was reduced by either astrocyte-specific genetic removal of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P(1)) or pharmacological inhibition by fingolimod (FTY720), an FDA-approved MS medicine that can functionally antagonize S1P(1). ieAstrocytes thus represent a functionally defined subset of disease-linked astrocytes that are the first and predominant CNS cell population activated during EAE, and that track with disease severity in vivo.

Ex vivo analyses of MS lesions have revealed cellular heterogeneity and variable T cell levels, which may have important implications for patient stratification and choice of DMT. Although MRI has proven valuable to monitor DMT efficacy, its lack of specificity for cellular subtypes highlights the need for complementary methods to improve lesion characterization. Here, we evaluated the potential of 2'-deoxy-2'-(18)F-fluoro-9-<ce><b2>-d-arabinofuranosylguanine ((18)F-FAraG) PET imaging to noninvasively assess infiltrating T cells and to provide, in combination with MRI, a novel tool to determine lesion types. Methods: We used a novel MS mouse model that combines cuprizone and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis to reproducibly induce 2 brain inflammatory lesion types, differentiated by their T cell content. (18)F-FAraG PET imaging, T2-weighted MRI, and T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI were performed before disease induction, during demyelination with high levels of innate immune cells, and after T cell infiltration. Fingolimod immunotherapy was used to evaluate the ability of PET and MRI to detect therapy response. Ex vivo immunofluorescence analyses for T cells, microglia/macrophages, myelin, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity were performed to validate the in<c2><a0>vivo findings. Results:(18)F-FAraG signal was significantly increased in the brain and spinal cord at the time point of T cell infiltration. (18)F-FAraG signal from white matter (corpus callosum) and gray matter (cortex, hippocampus) further correlated with T cell density. T2-weighted MRI detected white matter lesions independently of T cells. T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI indicated BBB disruption at the time point of T cell infiltration. Fingolimod treatment prevented motor deficits and decreased T cell and microglia/macrophage levels. In agreement, (18)F-FAraG signal was decreased in the brain and spinal cord of fingolimod-treated mice; T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI revealed intact BBB, whereas T2-weighted MRI findings remained unchanged. Conclusion: The combination of MRI and (18)F-FAraG PET enables detection of inflammatory demyelination and T cell infiltration in an MS mouse model, providing a new way to evaluate lesion heterogeneity during disease progression and after DMT.

Based on these associations, patients with multiple sclerosis are frequently supplemented with the vitamin D precursor cholecalciferol, although it is unclear whether this regimen is of therapeutic benefit. To model consequences of this common practice, mice were fed for more than 3 months with a low, medium or high dose of cholecalciferol, representative of vitamin D deficiency, modest and disproportionally high supplementation, respectively, in patients with multiple sclerosis. Compared to vitamin D-deprived mice, its moderate supplementation reduced the severity of subsequent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which was associated with an expansion of regulatory T cells. Direct exposure of murine or human T cells to vitamin D metabolites inhibited their activation. In contrast, mice with 25-(OH) vitamin D levels above 200 nmol/l developed fulminant experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with massive CNS infiltration of activated myeloid cells, Th1 and Th17 cells. When dissecting this unexpected outcome, we observed that high, but not medium dose vitamin D had caused mild hypercalcaemia, which rendered T cells more prone to pro-inflammatory activation. Exposing murine or human T cells to equivalent calcium concentrations in vitro enhanced its influx, triggering activation, upregulation of pro-inflammatory gene products and enhanced transmigration across a blood<e2><80><93>brain barrier model.

Anti-CD20 reduced mature B cells in all compartments examined, although a subpopulation of antigen-experienced B cells persisted in splenic follicles. Upon treatment cessation, CD20(+) B cells simultaneously repopulated in bone marrow and spleen before their reappearance in blood.

Th1/Th2/Th17 and Treg cell profiles were determined through ELISA, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR. Transcription factor expression levels in the CNS were assessed by real-time PCR and T cell differentiation was explored through flow cytometry examination. Pregnancy and pregnancy level of estrogen alleviated clinical manifestations in EAE induced mice, reduced CNS demyelination and cell infiltration, suppressed spleen T cell proliferation, enhanced production of anti-inflammatory cytokines in splenocytes and increased the percentage of Th2 and Treg cells. Furthermore, the results of real-time PCR for transcription factors and related cytokines of Th1/Th2/Th17 and Treg cells in CNS showed reduced expression levels of Th1 and Th17 transcription factors, including T-bet and ROR-<ce><b3>t, and decreased Th1 and Th17 cytokines including IFN-<ce><b3>, TNF-<ce><b1>, IL-17 and IL-23. These results are the first to indicate that pregnancy and pregnancy level of estrogen ameliorate the EAE condition by favoring Treg and Th2 differentiation through induced expression of Foxp3 and GATA3 in the CNS.

Administration of anti-EMMPRIN Abs reduces the severity of EAE. Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic with immune-modulatory properties that decreases the severity of EAE; it was recently found to attenuate the conversion from a first demyelinating event to clinically definite MS in a phase III trial. We investigated whether and how minocycline affects the expression of EMMPRIN on T cells in culture and in mice afflicted with EAE. EMMPRIN expression in cultures of mouse splenocytes or human PBMCs was elevated upon polyclonal T cell activation, and this was reduced by minocycline correspondent with decreased P-Akt levels. An established MS medication, IFN-<ce><b2>, also diminished EMMPRIN levels on human cells whereas this was not readily observed for fingolimod or monomethylfumarate. In EAE-afflicted mice, minocycline treatment significantly reduced EMMPRIN levels on splenic lymphocytes at the presymptomatic (day 7) phase, and prevented the development of disease. Day 7 spleen transcripts from minocycline-treated EAE mice had a significantly lower MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio, and significantly lower MCT-1 and CD98 levels, factors associated with EMMPRIN function. Day 16 (peak clinical severity) CNS samples from EAE mice had prominent representation of inflammatory perivascular cuffs, inflammatory molecules and EMMPRIN, and these were abrogated by minocycline.

To begin to understand what mechanisms might control this outcome, we examined the effect of a murine-CD52-specific mAb on the depletion and repopulation of immune cells in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. We tested whether the tolerance-promoting receptor programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) is required for disease remission post anti-CD52, and found that PD-1-deficient mice with a more severe EAE were nevertheless effectively treated with anti-CD52. Anti-CD52 increased the proportions of newly generated T cells and double-negative (DN) T cells while reducing newly generated B cells; the latter effect being associated with a higher expression of CD52 by these cells. In the longer term, anti-CD52 caused substantial increases in the proportion of newly generated lymphocytes and DN T cells in mice with EAE.

The peripheral nerves were free of electrophysiological and morphological alterations. Systemic treatment with 4-aminopyridine accelerated and partially restored conduction in the dorsal columns and roots, while increasing the body temperature had a detrimental effect, suggesting demyelination as a prominent pathophysiological mechanism.

We therefore measured calcium, reactive oxygen species levels and glutathione content in lymphocytes from immunized mice before onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from MS patients treated with DMF, and in mouse splenocytes treated ex vivo with DMF. This demonstrated altered redox states and increased lymphocytic calcium levels in all model systems. DMF caused an immediate influx of calcium from the extracellular space, long-term increased cytosolic calcium levels and reduced calcium stored in intracellular stores. The DMF-elicited current had the electrophysiological characteristics of a transient receptor potential channel and the intracellular calcium levels were normalized by antagonists of TRPA1. Interestingly, the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase SERCA2b was downregulated but more active due to glutathionylation of the redox-sensitive cysteine 674.

In animal models of various inflammatory and degenerative central nervous system disorders, GA-induced T cells cross the blood-brain barrier, secrete high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophins, and thus both reduce neuronal damage and promote neurogenesis. Recently, it has been suggested that GA itself may permeate the (impaired) blood-brain-barrier and directly protect neurons under conditions of inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration. To test this hypothesis, we examined the direct effects of GA on neuronal functionality and T cell-mediated neuronal apoptosis in culture, acute brain slices, and focal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. GA caused a depolarization of the resting membrane potential and led to an immediate impairment of action potential generation in neurons. Moreover, GA-incubated neurons underwent dose-dependent apoptosis. Apoptosis of ovalbumin peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex class I-expressing neurons induced by ovalbumin-specific effector T cells could be reduced by pre-incubation of T cells, but not neurons with GA. Similar results could be found using acute brain slices. In focal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, lesion size and neuronal apoptosis could be limited by pretreating rats with GA, whereas intracerebral GA application into the inflammatory lesion had no effect on neuronal survival.

Moreover, it has been shown that vitamin D downregulates major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. We here report about the impact of a dietary vitamin D supplementation on EAE in the rat strains having functionally relevant allelic variations in the CIITA (Mhc2ta) gene, a master regulator of MHC class II expression. Full length myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-EAE was induced in DA.PVG(av1)-Vra4 congenic rats harboring the Vra4 locus from PVG strain in the EAE- susceptible DA background, and compared to the parental strains. The congenic rats fed with either vitamin D supplemented, deprived or regular diet developed an intermediate clinical EAE phenotype, in contrast to DA and PVG strains. Immunopathological studies revealed vitamin D dose-dependent effect on demyelination and inflammatory infiltration of the central nervous system (CNS), expression of MHC class II and CIITA, as well as downregulation of a range of pro-inflammatory genes. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an impact of vitamin D on the target tissue pathology and peripheral immune response during EAE in DA.PVG(av1)-Vra4 congenic strain.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the glial response in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-induced mice treated with a combination of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and pregabalin (PGB). For that, 28 C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to the five experimental groups: na<c3><af>ve, EAE, EAE-DMF, EAE-PGB, and EAE-DMF + PGB. Pharmacological treatments were initiated with the beginning of clinical signs, and all animals were euthanized at 28 dpi for the lumbar spinal cord evaluation. The results demonstrated a stronger attenuation of the clinical presentation by the combined approach. DMF alone promoted the downregulation of Iba-1 (microglia/macrophages marker) in the ventral horn compared with the non-treated EAE animals (P < 0.05). PGB treatment was associated with reduced Iba-1 immunofluorescence in both the dorsal (P < 0.05) and ventral horn (P < 0.05) compared to EAE vehicle-treated counterparts. However, the combined approach reduced the Iba-1 marker in the dorsal (P < 0.05) and ventral (P < 0.01) horns compared to non-treated EAE animals and further reduced Iba-1 in the ventral horn compared to each drug-alone approach (P < 0.05). In addition, the combination of DMF and PGB reduced activated astrocytes (GFAP) in both the dorsal and ventral horns of the spinal cord to a na<c3><af>ve-like level and upregulated Nrf-2 expression.

We investigated the potential of vitamin D (VD) to enhance GC efficacy and the mechanisms underlying this VD/GC interaction. In vitro, GC receptor (GR) expression levels were quantified by ELISA and induction of T cell apoptosis served as a functional readout to assess synergistic 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (1,25D)/GC effects. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (MOG(35-55) EAE) was induced in mice with T cell-specific GR or mTORc1 deficiency. 25(OH)D (25D) levels were determined in two independent cohorts of MS patients with stable disease or relapses either responsive or resistant to GC treatment (initial cohort: n<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>110; validation cohort: n<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>85). Gene expression of human CD8(+) T cells was analyzed by microarray (n<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>112) and correlated with 25D serum levels. In vitro, 1,25D upregulated GR protein levels, leading to increased GC-induced T cell apoptosis. 1,25D/GC combination therapy ameliorated clinical EAE course more efficiently than respective monotherapies, which was dependent on GR expression in T cells. In MS patients from two independent cohorts, 25D deficiency was associated with GC-resistant relapses. Mechanistic studies revealed that synergistic 1,25D/GC effects on apoptosis induction were mediated by the mTOR but not JNK pathway. In line, 1,25D inhibited mTORc1 activity in murine T cells, and low 25D levels in humans were associated with a reduced expression of mTORc1 inhibiting tuberous sclerosis complex 1 in CD8(+) T cells. GR upregulation by 1,25D and 1,25D/GC synergism in vitro and therapeutic efficacy in vivo were abolished in animals with a T cell-specific mTORc1 deficiency. Specific inhibition of mTORc1 by everolimus increased the efficacy of GC in EAE. 1,25D augments GC-mediated effects in vitro and in vivo in a T cell-specific, GR-dependent manner via mTORc1 inhibition.

We investigated the mechanism of fingolimod action in the classical animal model of MS: experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Fingolimod treatment significantly reduced clinical scores and histopathology in this model, even when treatment was begun after the onset of pathology. The Akt-mTOR signaling pathway was shown to be activated in the EAE model, by measuring the abundance of downstream activation markers, pAkt and ps6k. And this pathway was inhibited when EAE mice were treated with fingolimod. Mice with EAE exhibited an increased frequency of Th1 cells in the spleen, with concomitant increases in the mRNA levels of Tbet and Ifng and increased IFN-<ce><b3> production by activated splenocytes; the frequency of Treg cells, as well as mRNA levels of Foxp3 and Tgfb, was reduced, as was TGF-<ce><b2> production by activated splenocytes.

Minocycline ameliorates the clinical severity of MS and exhibits antiinflammatory, neuroprotective activities, and good tolerance for long-term use, whereas it is toxic to the CNS. Recently, the immunomodulation and neuroprotection capabilities of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) were shown in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this study, we evaluated whether the combination of hBM-MSCs and a low-dose minocycline could produce beneficial effects in EAE mice. METHODS: The sensitivity of hBM-MSCs to minocycline was determined by an established cell-viability assay. Minocycline-treated hBM-MSCs were also characterized with flow cytometry by using MSC surface markers and analyzed for their multiple differentiation capacities. EAE was induced in C57BL/6 mice by using immunization with MOG35-55. Immunopathology assays were used to detect the inflammatory cells, demyelination, and neuroprotection. Interferon gamma (IFN-<ce><b3>)/tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-<ce><b1>) and interleukin-4 (IL-4)/interleukin-10 (IL-10), the hallmark cytokines that direct Th1 and Th2 development, were detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed to elucidate the cell apoptosis in the spinal cords of EAE mice. RESULTS: Minocycline did not affect the viability, surface phenotypes, or differentiation capacity of hBM-MSCs, while minocycline affected the viability of astrocytes at a high dose. In vivo efficacy experiments showed that combined treatment, compared to the use of minocycline or hBM-MSCs alone, resulted in a significant reduction in clinical scores, along with attenuation of inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. Moreover, the combined treatment with hBM-MSCs and minocycline enhanced the immunomodulatory effects, which suppressed proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-<ce><b3>, TNF-<ce><b1>) and conversely increased anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10). In addition, TUNEL staining also demonstrated a significant decrease of the number of apoptotic cells in the combined treatment compared with either treatment alone.

Minocycline, a potent inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, attenuates disease activity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Potential adverse effects associated with long-term daily minocycline therapy in human patients are concerning. Here, we investigated whether less frequent treatment with long-circulating polyethylene glycol (PEG) minocycline liposomes are effective in treating EAE. FINDINGS: Performing in vitro time kinetic studies of PEG minocycline-liposomes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we determined that PEG minocycline-liposome preparations stabilized with CaCl(2) are effective in diminishing MMP-9 activity. Intravenous injections of PEG minocycline-liposomes every five days were as effective in ameliorating clinical EAE as daily intraperitoneal injections of minocycline. Treatment of animals with PEG minocycline-liposomes significantly reduced the number of CNS-infiltrating leukocytes, and the overall expression of MMP-9 in the CNS. There was also a significant suppression of MMP-9 expression and proteolytic activity in splenocytes of treated animals, but not in CNS-infiltrating leukocytes. Thus, leukocytes gaining access to the brain and spinal cord require the same absolute amount of MMP-9 in all treatment groups, but minocycline decreases the absolute cell number. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that less frequent injections of PEG minocycline-liposomes are an effective alternative pharmacotherapy to daily minocycline injections for the treatment of CNS autoimmune diseases.

B cell depleting capacity was explored in healthy female C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice; following immune activation in two different mouse models: trinitrophenylated lipopolysaccharide model (thymus-independent response) and dinitrophenyl-keyhole limpet hemocyanin model (thymus-dependent response); and in a chronic neuroinflammation experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model. CD20 protein expression on B cell subpopulations was also studied. The subcutaneous anti-CD20 regimen resulted in rapid depletion of B cells in blood, lymph nodes and spleen. Low-dose subcutaneous treatment did not reduce antigen-specific immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G titers in all subgroups, and relatively spared splenic marginal zone (MZ) B cells in both T cell dependent and T cell independent B cell immunization models. Analysis of immune compartments during anti-CD20-modulated autoimmune neuroinflammation showed that the maximal B cell depletion was achieved within 2<c2><a0>days of treatment and was highest in the lymph node. Regardless of the tissues analyzed, low-dose subcutaneous treatment was characterized by rapid B cell repletion following treatment cessation. CD20 protein expression was consistent on all B cell subsets in blood, and was more pronounced in germinal center B cells of lymph nodes and MZ B-cells of the spleen. Low-dose subcutaneous anti-CD20 therapy effectively depleted B cells within lymphatic tissues and reduced the severity of neuroinflammation. These data suggest that subcutaneous anti-CD20 therapies can effectively target disease-relevant B cell populations, have shorter repletion kinetics and maintain vaccination responses, thereby achieving autoimmune amelioration without severely impacting immune surveillance functions.

While inflammation is present at all stages of MS, it is more pronounced in the relapsing forms of the disease, whereas progressive MS (PMS) shows significant neuroaxonal damage and grey and white matter atrophy. Hence, disease-modifying treatments beneficial in patients with relapsing MS have limited success in PMS. BAF312 (siponimod) is a novel sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator shown to delay progression in PMS. Besides reducing inflammation by sequestering lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues, BAF312 crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds its receptors on neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. To evaluate potential direct neuroprotective effects, BAF312 was systemically or locally administered in the CNS of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice with distinct grey- and white-matter lesions (focal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis using an osmotic mini-pump). Ex-vivo flow cytometry revealed that systemic but not local BAF312 administration lowered immune cell infiltration in animals with both grey and white matter lesions. Ex-vivo voltage-sensitive dye imaging of acute brain slices revealed an altered spatio-temporal pattern of activation in the lesioned cortex compared to controls in response to electrical stimulation of incoming white-matter fiber tracts.

This study investigated neurophysiological deficits in descending spinal cord motor tracts during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a model of multiple sclerosis) and the functional effectiveness of prophylactic or therapeutic teriflunomide treatment in preventing the debilitating paralysis observed in this model. Relapsing-remitting EAE was induced in Dark Agouti rats using rat spinal cord homogenate. Animals were treated with oral teriflunomide (10 mg/kg daily) prophylactically, therapeutically, or with vehicle (control). Transcranial magnetic motor-evoked potentials were measured throughout the disease to provide quantitative assessment of the neurophysiological status of descending motor tracts. Axonal damage was quantified histologically by silver staining. Both prophylactic and therapeutic teriflunomide treatment significantly reduced maximum EAE disease scores (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0001, respectively) compared with vehicle-treated rats. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that both teriflunomide treatment regimens prevented a delay in wave-form latency and a decrease in wave-form amplitude compared with that observed in vehicle-treated animals. A significant reduction in axonal loss was observed with both teriflunomide treatment regimens compared with vehicle (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0014, respectively). The results of this study suggest that therapeutic teriflunomide can prevent the deficits observed in this animal model in descending spinal cord motor tracts. The mechanism behind reduced axonal loss and improved motor function may be primarily the reduced inflammation and consequent demyelination observed in these animals through the known effects of teriflunomide on impairing proliferation of stimulated T cells.

In parallel to the reduced clinical symptoms, infiltration of immune cells in the brain was strongly reduced, and in isolated tissues of brain and spinal cord, the mRNA and protein expressions of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, as well as of matrix metalloproteinase-9 were reduced by all compounds, whereas PECAM-1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP-1 were upregulated.

It is a prodrug that requires activation by sphingosine kinase 2 (SK-2) to induce T cell homing to secondary lymphoid tissue. In this study, we have investigated the role of SK-2 in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6 mice. We show that SK-2 deficiency reduced clinical symptoms of EAE. Furthermore, in SK-2-deficient mice, the protective effect of FTY720 on EAE was abolished, while the non-prodrug FTY720-derivative ST-968 was still fully active. Protection was paralleled by reduced numbers of T-lymphocytes in blood and a reduced blood-brain-barrier leakage. This correlated with reduced mRNA expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, but enhanced expression of PECAM-1. A similar regulation of permeability and of PECAM-1 was seen in primary cultures of isolated mouse brain vascular endothelial cells and in a human immortalized cell line upon SK-2 knockdown. In summary, these data demonstrated that deletion of SK-2 exerts a protective effect on the pathogenesis of EAE in C57BL/6 mice and that SK-2 is essential for the protective effect of FTY720 but not of ST-968.

Thus, we hypothesized that mice with chronic EAE may also benefit from this combination therapy. We first assessed how a treatment with a single dose of GA together with daily application of EGCG may modulate EAE. Although single therapies with a suboptimal dose of GA or EGCG led to disease amelioration and reduced CNS inflammation, the combination therapy had no effects. While EGCG appeared to preserve axons and myelin, the single GA dose did not improve axonal damage or demyelination. Interestingly, the neuroprotective effect of EGCG was abolished when GA was applied in combination. To elucidate how a single dose of GA may interfere with EGCG, we focused on the anti-inflammatory, iron chelating and anti-oxidant properties of EGCG. Surprisingly, we observed that while EGCG induced a downregulation of the gene expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in affected CNS areas, the combined therapy of GA+EGCG seems to promote an increased HO-1 expression. These data suggest that upregulation of HO-1 may contribute to diminish the neuroprotective benefits of EGCG alone in this EAE model. Altogether, our data indicate that neuroprotection by EGCG in chronic EAE may involve regulation of oxidative processes, including downmodulation of HO-1.

We now show that estrogens ameliorate chronic EAE. Castration of female mice led to an earlier disease onset (day 9 +/- 2 postimmunization (p.i.) in castrated mice vs. day 16 +/- 4 p.i. in normal mice). Long-term treatment with high levels of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) given as Silastic implants led to a dramatically delayed onset of disease in both castrated and normal female mice (mean onset day was day 39 +/- 14 and day 50 +/- 3, respectively). Treatment of castrated females by injections of E2, at a concentration which induces the serum levels seen at late stage pregnancy, delayed the onset approximately 1 week (mean onset 21 +/- 8). In contrast, treatment with estriol (E3), which was also given at doses corresponding to those levels seen during pregnancy, delayed the disease onset for a longer time (mean onset day 31 +/- 5). Five times higher doses of E2, compared with those seen during pregnancy, were required to obtain similar effects as the low E3 dose. The same mouse strain (B10.RIII) is also susceptible to induction of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). We show here that also CIA is suppressed by the same treatments with E2 and E3, suggesting that similar estrogen-mediated mechanisms may operate to suppress these T-cell-dependent autoimmune disease models.",10.1016/0165-5728(94)90030-2,no,NA,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,B10.RIII,female,10,Estriol,control,1,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Failed,NA

A prevailing hypothesis is that GA can induce Th2-polarized T cells, which cross-recognize myelin-specific epitopes and can inhibit myelin-reactive autoaggression in Th1 T cells, a process referred to as 'bystander suppression.' To test whether the efficacy of GA is indeed mediated by Th2 T cells, we have utilized an animal model for MS: experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6 mice. GA therapy conferred moderate protection from EAE. GA-reactive T cells from these mice were not Th2 polarized, and the Th1 cytokine reduction of myelin-reactive T cells in GA-treated mice was comparable to that in untreated control mice. Significantly, the protective effects of GA against EAE were also observed in IL-4-, IL-10-deficient and IL-4/IL-10 double-deficient mice. Similar to wild-type mice, GA therapy in IL-4- and IL-10-deficient mice was associated with diminished myelin-reactive T cell expansion and reduced production of myelin antigen-induced IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Thus, despite the absence of two prominent Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-10, either alone or combined, GA was still beneficial in suppressing EAE.

The involvement of Tregs in therapies for immune-mediated diseases has been proposed, but direct supporting evidence is still lacking. While investigating mechanisms underlying the clinical benefits of glatiramer acetate (GA) in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), i.e., experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we recently demonstrated that GA can protect mice deficient in the Th(2) cytokines IL-4, IL-10 and IL-4/IL-10 from acquiring EAE, suggesting that mechanisms other than Th(2) cells may be responsible for the therapeutic effects of GA. Here we demonstrate that GA treatment boosts the expression of Foxp3 on Tregs during EAE. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of purified Tregs from GA-treated EAE mice is more effective in preventing EAE development than Tregs from untreated EAE controls. Thus, our current data provide evidence that Tregs may be the major contributor to GA's therapeutic action in EAE and, possibly, MS.

It acts as a functional antagonist for sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR). After phosphorylateion by sphingosine kinase in vivo, FTY binds to S1PR on lymphocytes to downregulate S1PR, thereby preventing lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissues to reduce infiltration of autoreactive lymphocytes into the central nervous system. FTY easily passes through the blood-brain barrier and directly affects cells in the central nervous system. Recently, we have shown that FTY exerts neuroprotective effects by suppressing pro-inflammatory functions of glial cells and by upregulating neuroprotective functions of neuronal and glial cells in vitro. In the present study, we examined whether FTY exerts neuroprotective effects in vivo in the chronic phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Methods Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced EAE mice were orally treated with FTY (1 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (water) once a day starting at the disease peak (15 days after immunization). To evaluate gliosis and axonal damage, the lumbar spinal cords were examined immunohistochemically at 28 days after immunization. Results FTY treatment starting at disease peak improved the severity of symptoms, and reduced gliosis and axonal damage in the spinal cord, as assessed by glial staining and formation of neuritic bead/spheroid.

CD320 was reduced in MS plaques. Deficiency of CD320 or dietary B12 worsened EAE and eliminated FTY720's efficacy, while concomitantly down-regulating type I interferon signaling. TCN2 functioned as a chaperone for FTY720 and sphingosine, which induced astrocytic CD320 internalization.

The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], has a direct repressive effect on the expression of IL-17A in both human and mouse T cells. In vivo treatment of mice with ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a mouse model of multiple sclerosis) diminishes paralysis and progression of the disease and reduces IL-17A-secreting CD4(+) T cells in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS). The mechanism of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) repression of IL-17A expression was found to be transcriptional repression, mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Transcription assays, gel shifting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicate that the negative effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on IL-17A involves blocking of nuclear factor for activated T cells (NFAT), recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC), sequestration of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)/VDR, and a direct effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on induction of Foxp3.

Currently available therapies have partially effective actions and numerous side reactions. Inosine, an endogenous purine nucleoside, has immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and analgesic properties. Herein, we evaluated the effect of inosine on the development and progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an experimental model of MS. Inosine (1 or 10<c2><a0>mg/kg, i.p.) was administrated twice a day for 40<c2><a0>days. Immunological and inflammatory responses were evaluated by behavioral, histological, immunohistochemical, ELISA, RT-PCR, and Western blotting analysis. The administration of inosine exerted neuroprotective effects against EAE by diminishing clinical signs, including thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia, as well as weight loss typical of the disease. These beneficial effects of inosine seem to be associated with the blockade of inflammatory cell entry into the CNS, especially lymphocytes, thus delaying the demyelinating process and astrocytes activation. In particular, up-regulation of IL-17 levels in the secondary lymphoid tissues, a result of EAE, was prevented by inosine treatment in EAE mice. Additionally, inosine consistently prevented A2AR up-regulation in the spinal cord, likely, through an ERK1-independent pathway. Altogether, these results allow us to propose that this endogenous purine might be a putative novel and helpful tool for the prevention of autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, such as MS. Thus, inosine could have considerable implications for future therapies of MS, and this study may represent the starting point for further investigation into the role of inosine and adenosinergic receptors in neuroinflammation processes. Graphical Abstract Preventive treatment with inosine inhibits the development and progression of EAE in C57Bl/6 mice. Furthermore, neuroinflammation and demyelinating processes were blocked by inosine treatment. Additionally, inosine consistently inhibited IL-17 levels in peripheral lymphoid tissue, as well as IL-4 levels and A2AR up-regulation in the spinal cord, likely, through an ERK1-independent pathway.

However, emerging evidence supports an important role for B cells in the pathogenesis and inhibition of MS. Glatiramer acetate (GA), a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for the treatment of MS, has a good safety profile. But GA's mechanism of action in MS is still elusive. In this study, we showed that B cells from GA-treated mice increased production of IL-10 and reduced expression of co-stimulatory molecules viz.: CD80 and CD86. B cells from GA-treated mice also diminished proliferation of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG(35-55)) specific T cells. Purified B cells transferred from GA-treated mice suppressed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in recipient mice compared with B cells transferred from mice treated with PBS or ovalbumin. The treatment effect of GA in EAE was abrogated in B cell-deficient mice. Transfer of B cells from GA-treated mice inhibited the proliferation of autoreactive T cells as well as the development of Th1 and Th17 cells but promoted IL-10 production in recipient mice. The number of peripheral CD11b(+) macrophages in recipient mice also decreased after transfer of B cells from GA-treated mice; however, the number of dendritic cells and regulatory T cells remained unaltered.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was induced in 14 marmosets by immunization with recombinant human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein in complete Freund adjuvant. At 21 days after immunization, B-cell depletion was achieved by weekly intravenous injections of HuMab 7D8, a human-anti-human CD20 antibody that cross-reacts with marmoset CD20. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging showed widespread brain white matter demyelination in control marmosets that was absent in CD20 antibody-treated marmosets. High-contrast postmortem magnetic resonance imaging showed white matter lesions in 4of the 7 antibody-treated marmosets, but these were significantly smaller than those in controls. The same technique revealed gray matter lesions in 5 control marmosets, but none in antibody-treated marmosets. Histologic analysis confirmed that inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage were substantially reduced in brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves of CD20 antibody-treated marmosets. In conclusion, CD20-postive B-cell depletion by HuMab 7D8 profoundly reduced the development of both white and gray matter lesions in the marmoset CNS.

The etiology of the disease remains unknown, which strongly impedes the development of effective therapy. Most MS treatments focus on modulating the activity of the immune system. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) exerts a broad spectrum of action, such as modulating immune cell differentiation towards anti-inflammatory subtypes, influencing cytokine production, regulating immune cell migration into the central nervous system, and activating intracellular antioxidant mechanisms. It is well established that activation of the nuclear factor E2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway, leading to expression of the second-phase antioxidant enzymes, is influenced by DMF. In our experiments we used female Lewis rats in an animal model of MS - experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). The rats were fed with dimethyl fumarate to test the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), one of the second-phase antioxidant enzymes, at specific time points of the symptomatic phases of the disease: on the first day of the occurrence of clinical symptoms (10th day post immunization, DPI); at the peak of clinical symptoms (14th DPI); and at the end of the relapse (21st DPI). The results showed that HO-1 expression, at both the mRNA and protein level, is influenced by DMF administration only at the very beginning of the symptomatic phase of EAE, and not at the peak of clinical symptoms, nor at the end of the relapse.

Leukocyte-endothelial adhesion at the blood-brain barrier is considered an essential step in the mediation of CNS leukocyte infiltration in EAE. AN100226m, a monoclonal antibody to alpha 4 integrin has been previously shown to reverse the clinical and histologic signs of EAE by blocking this interaction. In the present study, AN100226m treatment in acute EAE significantly decreased contrast enhancement of the CNS parenchyma indicating closure of the blood-brain barrier. The percentage of pixels due to leakage of contrast material in T1-weighted images decreased to < 4% in AN100226m-treated animals whereas it was increased to 15% in control animals (P < .05, Mann-Whitney rank sum test). A decrease in CNS abnormalities associated with cerebral edema and inflammation was also observed on T2-weighted images (P < .05, Mann-Whitney rank sum test). Thus, an antibody to alpha 4 integrin reversed the blood-brain barrier permeability changes characteristic of acute EAE. In addition, the further accumulation of inflammatory edema was prevented and preexisting edema was resolved.",10.1002/jmri.1880050510,no,NA,WZ,1,NA,EAE,guinea pig,Hartley,female,NA,Natalizumab,control,1,45,2,0.2,8,0.1,1.8,8,0.2,"mean, SEM",2,11,NA,15,18,NA,mean,gadolinium,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,guinea pig,Marketed,NA

However, the mechanisms by which ER<ce><b1> signaling contributes to changes in disease pathogenesis have not been completely elucidated.

Detailed immunohistologic studies showed that CTLA4Ig therapy resulted in suppression of the inflammatory response with inhibition of Th1 (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) and sparing of Th2 (IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13) cytokines in the central nervous system. These results indicate that the CD28-B7 T cell costimulatory pathway plays an important role in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a Th1-mediated disease, and suggest that blockade of this costimulatory pathway protects against active disease by causing a state of immune deviation towards Th2 function.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of the disease, was used to address the role of T regulatory cells (Tregs) in the anti-CD52 mAb-induced suppression of the disease. In vitro studies on PBMCs from RRMS patients and matched healthy controls determined the effect of IL-7 on the expansion of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-) Tregs and induction of their suppressive phenotype. This study using EAE animal models of MS has shown that mouse anti-CD52 mAb suppression of clinical disease was augmented by coadministration of IL-7 and partially reversed by anti-IL-7 mAb.

Three other FDA-approved S1PR modulators for MS-fingolimod, siponimod, and ozanimod-share peripheral immunological effects via common S1P(1) interactions, yet ponesimod may access distinct central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms through its selectivity for the S1P(1) receptor. Here, ponesimod was examined for S1PR internalization and binding, human astrocyte signaling and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) gene expression, and in vivo using murine cuprizone-mediated demyelination. Studies confirmed ponesimod's selectivity for S1P(1) without comparable engagement to the other S1PR subtypes (S1P(2,3,4,5) ). Ponesimod showed pharmacological properties of acute agonism followed by chronic functional antagonism of S1P(1) . A major locus of S1P(1) expression in the CNS is on astrocytes, and scRNA-seq of primary human astrocytes exposed to ponesimod identified a gene ontology relationship of reduced neuroinflammation and reduction in known astrocyte disease-related genes including those of immediate early astrocytes that have been strongly associated with disease progression in MS animal models. Remarkably, ponesimod prevented cuprizone-induced demyelination selectively in the cingulum, but not in the corpus callosum. These data support the CNS activities of ponesimod through S1P(1) , including protective, and likely selective, effects against demyelination in a major connection pathway of the brain, the limbic fibers of the cingulum, lesions of which have been associated with several neurologic impairments including MS fatigue.",10.1096/fj.202101531R,no,NA,WZ,1,NA,cuprizone,mouse,C57BL/6,male,8,Ponesimod,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of S1P receptors in a non-T-cell model of demyelination, the cuprizone (cupr) model in C57BL/6 mice. Treatment with FTY720 (1 mg/kg) led to attenuated injury to OLGs, myelin, and axons in the corpus callosum (percentage of myelinated fibers was 44.7% in cupr-water and 63% in cupr-FTY720). Reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis were ameliorated when FTY720 was given from d 1, but astrogliosis was augmented when FTY720 was given from wk 4-9. FTY720 did not promote remyelination in this model. The protective effect of FTY720 was associated with decreased interleukin-1<ce><b2> and CCL2 transcripts in the corpus callosum, as well as altered S1P1 expression. Targeted deletion of S1P1 in OLG lineage cells did not lead to obvious clinical phenotype, but resulted in subtle abnormalities in myelin and an increased susceptibility to cupr-induced demyelination.

Multiple sclerosis is induced through multiple mechanisms and is caused by inflammation and demyelination. This study aims to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of swimming exercise in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rats, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. METHODS: EAE was induced by an intradermal injection of 50-<ce><bc>g purified myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 33-55 (MOG33-55) dissolved in 200-<ce><bc>L saline at the base of the tail.

To compare the effect of swimming exercise with interferon-<ce><b2>, a drug for multiple sclerosis, interferon-<ce><b2> was injected intraperitoneally into rats of the EAE-induced and interferon-<ce><b2>-treated group during the exercise period. RESULTS: Injection of MOG33-55 caused weight loss, decreased clinical disability score, and increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators in the lumbar spinal cord. Loss of motor function and weakness increased demyelination score. Swimming exercise suppressed demyelination and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators. These changes promoted recovery of EAE symptoms such as body weight loss, motor dysfunction, and weakness. Swimming exercise caused the same level of improvement as interferon-<ce><b2> treatment.

However, the specific subtype of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors that mediates the effect of FTY720 on the CNS cells has not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) is elevated in reactive astrocytes in an autoimmunity independent mouse model of MS and that selective S1PR1 modulation is sufficient to ameliorate the loss of oligodendrocytes and demyelination. The non-selective S1PR modulator, FTY720, or a short-lived S1PR1-specific modulator, CYM5442, was administered daily to mice while on cuprizone diet. Both FTY720- and CYM5422-treated mice displayed a significant reduction in oligodendrocyte apoptosis and astrocyte and microglial activation in comparison to vehicle-treated groups, which was associated with decreased production of proinflammatory mediators and down-regulation of astrocytic S1PR1 protein. Interestingly, S1PR1 modulation during the early phase of cuprizone intoxication was required to suppress oligodendrocyte death and consequent demyelination as drug treatment from 10 days after the initiation of cuprizone feeding was no longer effective. CYM5442 treatment during the brief cuprizone exposure significantly prevented Il-1<ce><b2>, Il-6, Cxcl10, and Cxcl3 induction, resulting in suppression of subsequent reactive gliosis and demyelination.

Interestingly, both EAE and MS have been shown to be ameliorated during late pregnancy. METHODS: Estriol, progesterone, and placebo pellets were implanted in mice during the effector phase of adoptive EAE. Disease scores were compared between treatment groups, and autoantigen-specific humoral and cellular responses were examined. RESULTS: Estriol treatment reduced the severity of EAE significantly compared with placebo treatment whereas progesterone treatment had no effect. Estriol doses that induced serum estriol levels that approximated estriol levels during late pregnancy were capable of ameliorating disease. Estriol-treated EAE mice had significantly higher levels of serum antibodies of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 isotype specific for the autoantigen myelin basic protein (MBP). Further, MBP-specific T-lymphocyte responses from estriol-treated EAE mice were characterized by significantly increased production of the Th2 cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10). T lymphocytes were shown to be the primary source of IL-10 within antigen-stimulated splenocyte populations.

Methods: OSE mice with a postnatal age of 21 to 28 days without signs of encephalomyelitis were treated once daily either with 150 <c2><b5>g GA or vehicle intraperitoneally (i. p.). The animals were scored daily regarding clinical signs and weight. The animals were sacrificed after 30 days of treatment or after having reached a score of 7.0 due to animal care guidelines.

There was, however, a modest reduction of the Iba1(+) area (p < 0.05) and F4/80(+) area upon GA treatment (p < 0.05). The immune cell composition of secondary lymphoid organs showed a trend towards an upregulation of regulatory T cells, which lacked significance.

Emotional and cognitive deficits are now recognized as primary disease manifestations and not simply the consequence of living with a chronic condition, raising questions regarding the efficacy of current therapeutics for these specific symptoms. Mechanisms underlying psychiatric sequelae in MS are believed to be similar to those underlying pathogenesis, that is mediated by cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of MS depression, we performed behavioral assays in the murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) MS model, in the presence or absence of immunomodulation using the drug FTY720, an analogue of the lipid signaling molecule sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Specifically, mice were challenged with the elevated plus maze (EPM) test, a validated experimental paradigm for rodent-specific anxiety-like behavior. FTY720 treatment failed to ameliorate anxiety-like symptoms, irrespective of dosage. On the other hand, it was effective in reducing inflammatory infiltration, microglial reactivity and levels of pro-inflammatory molecules in the hippocampus, confirming the anti-inflammatory capacity of treatment. To explore the absence of FTY720 effect on behavior, we confirmed expression of S1P receptors (S1PR) S1PR1, S1PR3 and S1PR5 in the hippocampus and mapped the dynamics of these receptors in response to drug treatment alone, or in combination with EAE induction. We identified a complex pattern of responses, differing between (1) receptors, (2) dosage and (3) hippocampal sub-field. FTY720 treatment in the absence of EAE resulted in overall downregulation of S1PR1 and S1PR3, while S1PR5 exhibited a dose-dependent upregulation.

While low VitD levels strongly correlate with higher MS risk in white populations, this is not the case for other ethnic groups, suggesting the existence of a genetic component. Moreover, VitD supplementation studies in MS so far have not shown a consistent benefit. We sought to determine whether direct manipulation of VitD levels modulates central nervous system autoimmune disease in a sex-by-genotype-dependent manner. To this end, we used a dietary model of VitD modulation, together with the autoimmune animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). To assess the impact of genotype-by-VitD interactions on EAE susceptibility, we utilized a chromosome substitution (consomic) mouse model that incorporates the genetic diversity of wild-derived PWD/PhJ mice. High VitD was protective in EAE in female, but not male C57BL/6J (B6) mice, and had no effect in EAE-resistant PWD/PhJ (PWD) mice. EAE protection was accompanied by sex- and genotype-specific suppression of proinflammatory transcriptional programs in CD4 T effector cells, but not CD4 regulatory T cells. Decreased expression of proinflammatory genes was observed with high VitD in female CD4 T effector cells, specifically implicating a key role of MHC class II genes, interferon gamma, and Th1<e2><80><89>cell-mediated neuroinflammation. In consomic strains, effects of VitD on EAE were also sex- and genotype dependent, whereby high VitD: (1) was protective, (2) had no effect, and (3) unexpectedly had disease-exacerbating effects. Systemic levels of 25(OH)D differed across consomic strains, with higher levels associated with EAE protection only in females. Analysis of expression of key known VitD metabolism genes between B6 and PWD mice revealed that their expression is genetically determined and sex specific and implicated Cyp27b1 and Vdr as candidate genes responsible for differential EAE responses to VitD modulation. Taken together, our results support the observation that the association between VitD status and MS susceptibility is genotype dependent and suggest that the outcome of VitD status in MS is determined by gene-by-sex interactions.",10.3389/fimmu.2018.01622,no,NA,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,"C57BL/6, PWD, C57BL/6.ChrPWD",both,9,Vitamin D3,control,1,209,0,1.3,24,0.3,1.9,33,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Scores obtained from B6 strain,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Failed,NA

This is owing to the long duration of disease induction and observation of treatment effects in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. We propose a novel adult zebrafish based model which offers a quick and simple protocol that can used to screen candidates as a step between in vitro experiments and rodent studies. The experiments conducted for this manuscript were to standardize a suitable model of EAE in adult zebrafish and validate it using known modulators. METHODS: The EAE model was developed by disease induction with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein - 35-55 (MOG) and observation of survival, clinical signs and body weight changes. We have validated this model using fingolimod. We have further performed detailed validation using dimethyl fumarate, dexamethasone and SR1001, which are known modulators of rodent EAE. RESULTS: The immunization dose for the disease induction was observed to be 0.6mg/ml of MOG in CFA (Complete Freund's adjuvant), injected subcutaneously (s.c.) near spinal vertebrae. In the validation study with fingolimod, we have demonstrated the modulation of disease symptoms, which were also confirmed by histopathological evaluation. Furthermore, detailed validation with three other known drugs showed that our observations concur with those reported in conventional rodent models. DISCUSSION: We have standardized and validated the adult zebrafish EAE model. This model can help get a quick idea of in vivo activity of drugs in a week using very low quantities of candidate compounds. Further work will be required to define this model particularly as it is found that zebrafish may not express a MOG homologue.",10.1016/j.msard.2016.11.010,no,NA,WZ,1,NA,EAE,zebrafish,NA,NA,20,Fingolimod,control,NA,144,"1,2",1.1,12,0.1,3.8,12,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,zebrafish,Marketed,NA

Here we show that amelioration of MS by dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a mechanistically elusive drug, associates with suppression of Tc17 cells. DMF treatment results in reduced frequency of Tc17, contrary to Th17 cells, and in a decreased ratio of the regulators RORC-to-TBX21, along with a shift towards cytotoxic T lymphocyte gene expression signature in CD8(+) T cells from MS patients. Mechanistically, DMF potentiates the PI3K-AKT-FOXO1-T-BET pathway, thereby limiting IL-17 and ROR<ce><b3>t expression as well as STAT5-signaling in a glutathione-dependent manner. This results in chromatin remodeling at the Il17 locus. Consequently, T-BET-deficiency in mice or inhibition of PI3K-AKT, STAT5 or reactive oxygen species prevents DMF-mediated Tc17 suppression.

In astrocyte cell culture, the addition of pro-inflammatory cytokines led to a significant downregulation of glutamate transporters glutamate transporter-1 (slc1a2/SLC1A2) and glutamate aspartate transporter (slc1a3/SLC1A3) expression on the mRNA or protein level. In this setting, the direct application of fingolimod-1 phosphate (F1P) on astrocytes did not change expression levels of slc1a2 and slc1a3 mRNA. The analysis of both transporters on the protein level by Western Blot and immunocytochemistry did also not reveal any effect of F1P. On a functional level, the addition of conditioned supernatants from F1P treated astrocytes to neuronal cell culture did not result in increased neurite growth. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis as a model of multiple sclerosis, fingolimod treatment reduced T cell and macrophages/microglia mediated inflammation and also diminished astrocyte activation. At the same time, fingolimod restored the reduced expression of slc1a2 and slc1a3 in the inflamed spinal cord on the mRNA level and of SLC1A2 and SLC1A3 on the protein level, presumably via indirect, anti-inflammatory mechanisms.

Our recent studies in the MS model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) attributed clinical benefit to extinction of activated B-cells, but cautioned that depletion of na<c3><af>ve B-cells may be undesirable. We elucidated the regulatory role of un-activated B-cells in EAE and investigated whether anti-CD20 may collaterally diminish regulatory B-cell properties in treatment of neuroimmunological disorders.Methods: Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide-immunized C57Bl/6 mice were depleted of B-cells. Functional consequences for regulatory T-cells (Treg) and cytokine production of CD11b+ antigen presenting cells (APC) were assessed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 22 patients receiving anti-CD20 and 23 untreated neuroimmunological patients were evaluated for frequencies of B-cells, T-cells and monocytes; monocytic reactivity was determined by TNF-production and expression of signalling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM).Results: We observed that EAE-exacerbation upon depletion of un-activated B-cells closely correlated with an enhanced production of pro-inflammatory TNF by CD11b+ APC. Paralleling this pre-clinical finding, anti-CD20 treatment of human neuroimmunological disorders increased the relative frequency of monocytes and accentuated pro-inflammatory monocyte function; when reactivated ex vivo, a higher frequency of monocytes from B-cell depleted patients produced TNF and expressed the activation marker SLAM.Conclusions: These data suggest that in neuroimmunological disorders, pro-inflammatory APC activity is controlled by a subset of B-cells which is eliminated concomitantly upon anti-CD20 treatment. While this observation does not conflict with the general concept of B-cell depletion in human autoimmunity, it implies that its safety and effectiveness may further advance by selectively targeting pathogenic B-cell function. <c2><a9> 2011 Lehmann-Horn et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1742-2094-8-146,no,NA,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,NA,Rituximab,control,2,NA,0,2.7,5,0.5,1.3,5,0.6,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

However, the role of S1P receptors on monocytes is less clear. To elucidate this, we systematically evaluated monocytes in rats and mice, both in naive and inflammatory conditions, with S1P receptor modulators FTY720 and BAF312. We demonstrate that S1P receptor modulators reduce circulating monocytes in a similar time course as lymphocytes. Furthermore, total monocyte numbers were increased in the spleen and bone marrow, suggesting that S1P receptor modulation restricts egress from hematopoietic organs. Monocytes treated ex vivo with FTY720 had reduced CD40 expression and TNF-<ce><b1> production, suggesting a direct effect on monocyte activation. Similar reductions in protein expression and cytokine production were also found in vivo. Suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice and rats by FTY720 correlated with reduced numbers of lymphocytes and monocytes. These effects on monocytes were independent of S1P3, as treatment with BAF312, a S1P1,4,5 modulator, led to similar results.

Mice were imaged with bis-5-hydroxytryptamide-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate gadolinium (hereafter, MPO-Gd) MRI. One-way analysis of variance, two-way analysis of variance, Kurskal-Wallis, and log-rank tests were used. P < .05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Results The combination-treated group showed delayed disease onset (day 11.3 vs day 9.8 for ABAH, day 10.4 for GA, day 9.9 for control; P < .05) and reduced disease severity (clinical score during the acute exacerbation period of 1.8 vs 3.8 for ABAH, 3.1 for GA, 3.9 for control; P < .05). The combination-treated group demonstrated fewer MPO-positive lesions (30.2 vs 73.7 for ABAH, 64.8 for GA, 67.2 for control; P < .05), smaller MPO-positive lesion volume (16.7 mm(3) vs 65.2 mm(3) for ABAH, 69.9 mm(3) for GA, 66.0 mm(3) for control; P < .05), and lower intensity of MPO-Gd lesion activation ratio (0.7 vs 1.9 for ABAH, 3.2 for GA, 2.3 for control; P < .05). Reduced disease severity in the combination group was confirmed at histopathologic analysis, where MPO expression (1779 vs 2673 for ABAH, 2898 for GA; P < .05) and demyelination (5.3% vs 9.0% for ABAH, 10.6% for GA; P < .05) were ameliorated. Conclusion Myeloperoxidase molecular MRI can track the treatment response from immunomodulatory drugs even if the drug does not directly target myeloperoxidase, and establishes that combination therapy targeting both myeloid and lymphocytic inflammation is effective for murine autoimmune neuroinflammation, even at suboptimal doses. <c2><a9> RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

We sought in this study to determine whether the anti-immune/anti-inflammatory action of 1,25(OH)2D3 is in part mediated through an interplay between 1,25(OH)2D3 and toll-like receptor (TLR)7/8 signaling. 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment prior to and/or following experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induction effectively reduced inflammatory cytokine expression in the spinal cord and ameliorated EAE. These effects were accompanied with a reduction in expression of several TLRs with the most profound effect observed for TLR8. The expression of TLR8 adaptor protein MyD88 was also significantly reduced by 1,25(OH)2D3. To determine the molecular mechanism by which 1,25(OH)2D3 suppresses EAE induction of TLR8 and inflammatory cytokine expression, we evaluated whether 1,25(OH)2D3 can directly inhibit TLR8 signaling and the resulting inflammatory responses in human THP-1 monocytes. 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment not only significantly reduced TLR8 expression but also the expression or activity of MyD88, IRF-4, IRF-7 and NF-kB in monocytes challenged with TLR8 ligands. TLR8 promoter-luciferase reporter assays indicated that 1,25(OH)2D3 decreases TLR8 mRNA level in part via inhibiting TLR8 gene transcription activity. As a result of inhibition on TLR8 signaling cascade at various stages, 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly diminished the TLR8 target gene expression (TNF-<ce><b1> and IL-1<ce><b2>). In summary, our novel findings suggest that TLR8 is a new target of 1,25(OH)2D3 and may mediate the anti-inflammatory action of 1,25(OH)2D3. Our findings also point to a destructive role of TLR8 in EAE and shed lights on pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. <c2><a9> 2013 Li et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0058808,no,NA,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,10,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,"0,1",0.3,4.5,0.2,2,4.5,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Failed,NA

Several recent studies indicate that components of the inflammatory response to demyelination may be beneficial for the regenerative process of remyelination. In this study we examined the effects of minocycline on remyelination independent of its effects in limiting immune-mediated white matter damage using a toxin model of demyelination. Demyelinating lesions were induced by injection of ethidium bromide into caudal cerebellar peduncles of adult rats. Minocycline or PBS was administered by twice daily injections from day 1 prior to lesion-induction to post lesion day 3. Remyelination was assessed, blinded to grouping, using standard morphological criteria. The microglia activation within the lesion was assessed by examining the expression of OX-42 and major histocompatibility class II immunoreactivity. The oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) response was quantified by in situ hybridization using probes for OPC-expressed mRNAs, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha and Olig-1. Minocycline treatment strongly inhibited microglia/macrophage activation at day 1 and day 3 post-lesion induction, and suppressed the OPC response to demyelination. We also found a significant decrease in the extent of oligodendrocyte but not Schwann cell remyelination in the minocycline-treated animals as compared with controls at 3 weeks post-lesion induction. These results indicate that microglia/macrophage activation is an important process for remyelination and further support the concept that suppression of inflammatory response may impair remyelination.",10.1016/j.jneuroim.2004.08.011,no,NA,WZ,1,NA,ethidium bromide,rat,Sprague-Dawley,female,9.5,Minocycline,control,3,54,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,rat,Failed,NA

Here, we show that dimethyl fumarate exerts a profound alteration of the metabolic profile of human CD4+ as well as CD8+ T cells and restricts their antioxidative capacities by decreasing intracellular levels of the reactive oxygen species scavenger glutathione. This causes an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels accompanied by an enhanced mitochondrial stress response, ultimately leading to impaired mitochondrial function. Enhanced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels not only result in enhanced T-cell apoptosis in vitro as well as in dimethyl fumarate-treated patients, but are key for the well-known immunomodulatory effects of dimethyl fumarate both in vitro and in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, i.e. experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Indeed, dimethyl fumarate immune-modulatory effects on T cells were completely abrogated by pharmacological interference of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. These data shed new light on dimethyl fumarate as bona fide immune-metabolic drug that targets the intracellular stress response in activated T cells, thereby restricting mitochondrial function and energetic capacity, providing novel insight into the role of oxidative stress in modulating cellular immune responses and T cell-mediated autoimmunity.",10.1093/brain/awab307,no,NA,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,both,11,Dimethyl fumarate,control,NA,NA,0,1.8,10.5,0.1,4,10.5,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

The use of a preclinical animal model, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) has deepened our knowledge of the immunomodulatory functions of TnP as a drug. We have shown that TnP possesses a disease suppressive function in EAE, ameliorating disease severity by 40% and suppressing the accumulation of T helper (Th)1- and Th17-producing lymphocytes (by 55% and 60%, respectively) in CNS along with activated microglia/macrophages populations (by 33% and 50%, respectively), and also conferred a protective effect anticipating the remyelination process to day 66 compared to day 83 of untreated cuprizone-mice. Here we expanded our knowledge about its effects compared with current first-line disease-modifying therapies (DMT). We demonstrated that prophylactic treatment with TnP generated similar protection to betaseron (30%) or was more effective than glatiramer (44% versus 6%) or fingolimod (50% versus 19%) against the development of clinical symptoms. Although TnP controlled the leukocyte infiltration (87% versus 82%) into demyelinated areas of the spinal cord in the same way as betaseron and fingolimod, it was more effective (72% to 78% decrease) in the long-term control of neuronal degeneration compared to them. Also, when compared to glatiramer, TnP was more efficient in reversing leukocytes infiltration into the spinal cord (55% versus 24%), as well as induced a higher percentage of regulatory cells in spleen (2.9-fold versus 2.3-fold increase over vehicle-treated EAE mice) an in the spinal cord (8-fold versus 6-fold increase over vehicle-treated EAE mice).

Thus, novel therapeutics enhancing cellular resistance to free radicals could prove useful for multiple sclerosis treatment. BG00012 is an oral formulation of dimethylfumarate. In a phase II multiple sclerosis trial, BG00012 demonstrated beneficial effects on relapse rate and magnetic resonance imaging markers indicative of inflammation as well as axonal destruction. First we have studied effects of dimethylfumarate on the disease course, central nervous system, tissue integrity and the molecular mechanism of action in an animal model of chronic multiple sclerosis: myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in C57BL/6 mice. In the chronic phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, preventive or therapeutic application of dimethylfumarate ameliorated the disease course and improved preservation of myelin, axons and neurons. In vitro, the application of fumarates increased murine neuronal survival and protected human or rodent astrocytes against oxidative stress. Application of dimethylfumarate led to stabilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2, activation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2-dependent transcriptional activity and accumulation of NADP(H) quinoline oxidoreductase-1 as a prototypical target gene. Furthermore, the immediate metabolite of dimethylfumarate, monomethylfumarate, leads to direct modification of the inhibitor of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, at cysteine residue 151. In turn, increased levels of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 and reduced protein nitrosylation were detected in the central nervous sytem of dimethylfumarate-treated mice. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 was also upregulated in the spinal cord of autopsy specimens from untreated patients with multiple sclerosis. In dimethylfumarate-treated mice suffering from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, increased immunoreactivity for nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 was detected by confocal microscopy in neurons of the motor cortex and the brainstem as well as in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. In mice deficient for nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 on the same genetic background, the dimethylfumarate mediated beneficial effects on clinical course, axon preservation and astrocyte activation were almost completely abolished thus proving the functional relevance of this transcription factor for the neuroprotective mechanism of action. We conclude that the ability of dimethylfumarate to activate nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 may offer a novel cytoprotective modality that further augments the natural antioxidant responses in multiple sclerosis tissue and is not yet targeted by other multiple sclerosis therapies.",10.1093/brain/awq386,no,NA,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,10,Dimethyl fumarate,control,1,NA,1,2.6,7,0.1,4,7,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

Our study shows that oral tolerance was readily induced in IFN-beta(-/-) mice compared with their wild-type littermates (IFN-beta(+/+)). The non-self-antigen ovalbumin induced oral tolerance in both groups. These data indicate that endogenous IFN-beta is not required for induction of oral tolerance, whereas delivery of recombinant IFN-beta results in significant reduction in clinical score of EAE. Oral tolerance induction was associated with lower production of antigen-specific IFN-gamma, no shift toward antigen-specific Th2, Th17 or TGF-beta response was observed.

249,"LoPresti, P.",2015,Neurochem Res,Glatiramer acetate guards against rapid memory decline during relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,"Cognitive decline presents a therapeutic challenge for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease characterized by recurrent autoimmune demyelination and by progressive CNS degeneration. Glatiramer acetate (GA, also known as Copolymer 1, Cop-1, or Copaxone), commonly used to treat MS, reduces the frequency of relapses; it has both anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. However, clinical trials have not definitively shown that GA improves cognitive impairment during MS. Using an in vivo animal model of autoimmune demyelination, i.e., relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we tested short-term memory in EAE mice (EAE), in EAE mice treated with GA for 10 days starting at the time of immunization (EAE + GA), and in age-matched healthy, na<c3><af>ve mice (Na<c3><af>ve). Short-term memory was assessed using the cross-maze test at 10, 20, and 30 days post-immunization (d.p.i.); data were analyzed at each time point and over time. At 10 d.p.i., EAE and EAE + GA mice had better memory function than Na<c3><af>ve mice. However, at the later time points, EAE mice had a steep negative slope of memory function (indicating decline), whereas EAE + GA mice had a flatter, less-negative slope of memory function. Notably, the memory function of EAE mice significantly decreased over time compared with that of Na<c3><af>ve mice, indicating that EAE had a negative impact on cognitive ability. In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference between the slopes of memory function in mice with EAE treated with GA versus Na<c3><af>ve mice, which revealed effective, albeit partial, protection by GA treatment against progressive memory decline during EAE disease. Of particular interest, although EAE mice had memory decline over 30 d.p.i., their clinical disease scores improved during that time. Thus, our results suggest that EAE mice had a significant progressive memory decline and that GA, administered at the time of immunization, partially guards against rapid memory decline.",10.1007/s11064-014-1491-z,no,NA,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,NA,9,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,29,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

Statins are effective in the treatment of MS animal models and are promising candidates for future treatment. Minocycline ameliorates clinical severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and exhibits several anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities. In this study, we tested whether the combination of these two drugs could produce beneficial effects in EAE mice immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG). Our findings show that combined treatment, compared to using the medications alone, resulted in a significant reduction in disease severity, in both the acute and chronic phases of the disease, along with attenuation of inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. Stereological analysis revealed that the combined treatment significantly guarded against neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Moreover, a significant suppression of anti-MOG antibody production in animals treated with the two medications was found.

Functional and histopathological data of RGCs and optic nerves revealed neuronal and axonal protection when minocycline treatment was started on the day of immunization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that minocycline-induced neuroprotection is related to a direct antagonism of multiple mechanisms leading to neuronal cell death such as the induction of anti-apoptotic intracellular signalling pathways and a decrease in glutamate excitotoxicity. From these observations, we conclude that minocycline exerts neuroprotective effects independent of its anti-inflammatory properties.

Phycocyanobilin (PCB), a chromophore of the biliprotein C-Phycocyanin (C-PC) from Spirulina platensis, has antioxidant, immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in this disease, and it could complement the effect of other Disease Modifying Treatments (DMT), such as Interferon-<ce><b2> (IFN-<ce><b2>). Here, our main goal was to evaluate the potential PCB benefits and its mechanisms of action to counteract the chronic EAE in mice. MOG(35-55)-induced EAE was implemented in C57BL/6 female mice. Clinical signs, pro-inflammatory cytokines levels by ELISA, qPCR in the brain and immunohistochemistry using precursor/mature oligodendrocytes cells antibodies in the spinal cord, were assessed. PCB enhanced the neurological condition, and waned the brain concentrations of IL-17A and IL-6, pro-inflammatory cytokines, in a dose-dependent manner.

METHODS: The current study investigated the effect of antigen B of hydatid cyst fluid on the reduction of anti-inflammatory cytokines and nerve conduction velocity in rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-induced MS. After isolation of antigen B from sterile cyst fluid, the rats were randomly divided into four groups: saline, EAE, EAE + teriflunomide (EAE + TF), and EAE + antigen B (EAE + AngB). The EAE model was induced using cow spinal cord homogenization, in combination with Freund's complete adjuvant. The serum concentration of cytokines including IL-1B and IL-17, IL-10, IL-6, and TNF-X was measured by the ELISA method, and real-time PCR was performed to study gene expression. Electrophysiological, behavioral, and neuropathological tests were also conducted. RESULTS: Nerve conduction velocity and IL-10 concentration were increased in the antigen B group. The results of this study showed that antigen B reduced the inflammatory component of the EAE MS animal model by modulating the immune system compared to teriflunomide, which eventually led to a reduction in symptoms at the behavioral and electrophysiological level.

In the present study, we investigated whether GA has a positive influence on the loss of inputs to the motoneurons during the course of EAE in rats. Lewis rats were subjected to EAE associated with GA or placebo treatment. The animals were sacrificed after 15 days of treatment and the spinal cords processed for immunohistochemical analysis and transmission electron microscopy.

Ultrastructural analysis of the terminals apposed to alpha motoneurons was also performed by electron transmission microscopy. Interestingly, although the GA treatment preserved synaptophysin labeling, it did not significantly reduce the glial reaction, indicating that inflammatory activity was still present. Also, ultrastructural analysis showed that GA treatment significantly prevented retraction of both F and S type terminals compared to placebo.

METHODS: The effect of TF on oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation and differentiation was assessed in vitro in glial cultures derived from neonatal mice and confirmed on fluorescence-activated cell sorting-sorted adult OPCs. The levels of the 8,9-unsaturated sterols lanosterol and zymosterol were quantified in TF- and sham-treated cultures. In vivo, TF was administered orally, and remyelination was assessed both in myelin basic protein-GFP-nitroreductase (Mbp:GFP-NTR) transgenic Xenopus laevis demyelinated by metronidazole and in adult mice demyelinated by lysolecithin. RESULTS: In cultures, low concentrations of TF down to 10 nM decreased OPC proliferation and increased their differentiation, an effect that was also detected on adult OPCs. Oligodendrocyte differentiation induced by TF was abrogated by the oxidosqualene cyclase inhibitor Ro 48-8071 and was mediated by the accumulation of zymosterol. In the demyelinated tadpole, TF enhanced the regeneration of mature oligodendrocytes up to 2.5-fold. In the mouse demyelinated spinal cord, TF promoted the differentiation of newly generated oligodendrocytes by a factor of 1.7-fold and significantly increased remyelination. DISCUSSION: TF enhances zymosterol accumulation in oligodendrocytes and CNS myelin repair, a beneficial off-target effect that should be investigated in patients with multiple sclerosis.",10.1212/nxi.0000000000001091,no,NA,WZ,1,NA,lysolecithin,"mouse, xenopus",C57BL/6,NA,NA,Teriflunomide,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse, xenopus",Marketed,NA

Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein is a minor component of the myelin sheath, but is an important autoantigen linked to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). CNPase is expressed exclusively by oligodendrocytes in the CNS, and the appearance of CNPase seems to be one of the earliest events of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. In this study the effects of vitamin D on total protein concentration, CNPase and MOG expression in the cerebral cortex of the murine model of cuprizone-induced demyelination was investigated. The mice were treated by cuprizone for five weeks in order to induce demyelination. The mice were then divided into 3 groups. The first group was injected intraperitoneally (IP) with vitamin D diluted in olive oil in the amount of 5 <c2><b5>g/kg/daily body weight. The second group (SHAM) was injected IP with olive oil and the third group was left without any injection as the control group (n = 11 for each group). After five weeks the mice were killed and the cerebral cortex was collected and the expression of CNPase and MOG was studied by Western blot. Total protein concentration in the vitamin D injected, SHAM and control groups were 0.918 <c2><b1> 0.003, 0917 <c2><b1> 0.004 and 0.916 <c2><b1> 0.004 g/l, respectively (p > 0.05).

The inhibition of EAE induction is associated with a profound reduction of MOG35-55-specific proliferation and Th1 cell development. Importantly, the non-hypercalcemic analogue also provides long-term protection from EAE relapses induced by immunization with spinal cord homogenate when administered for a short time at symptom onset or even after the first peak of disease. Neuropathological analysis shows a reduction of inflammatory infiltrates, demyelinated areas and axonal loss in brains and spinal cords of treated mice.

METHODS: The effects of LINGO-1 antagonists on the differentiation of OPCs and the promotion of myelination has been assayed using a combination of coculture and slice culture preparations. Using three different animal models of demyelination and remyelination, we morphologically and functionally assessed the effects of LINGO-1 antagonists on OPC differentiation and myelin repair. RESULTS: The data indicate that in vitro treatment with antagonists of LINGO-1 promote OPC differentiation and myelination, whereas in vivo remyelination is accelerated in lysophosphatidylcholine- or cuprizone-induced demyelination. This remyelination is associated with enhanced OPC differentiation and functional recovery of conduction velocities in demyelinated axons. INTERPRETATION: Our studies demonstrate that LINGO-1 antagonism promotes OPC differentiation and remyelination, and suggest LINGO-1 functions as an inhibitor of OPC differentiation to retard central nervous system remyelination.",10.1002/ana.21581,no,NA,WZ,1,NA,"EAE, cuprizone, lysolecithin",rat,Sprague-Dawley,NA,9,Opicinumab,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse, rat",Failed,NA

We recently described the therapeutic activity of the association between myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG) and active vitamin D3 (VitD) against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The objective of this work was to evaluate the prophylactic potential of this association in EAE. C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated with MOG in the presence of VitD and then subjected to EAE induction. Animals were euthanized 7 and 19days after disease induction and the following parameters were evaluated: body weight, clinical score, inflammatory process in the CNS, amount of dendritic cells (DCs) and regulatory T cells in the spleen and cytokine production by spleen and CNS cell cultures. Vaccination with MOG associated with VitD determined a drastic reduction in clinical score, body weight loss, CNS inflammation, DCs maturation and also in the production of cytokines by CNS and spleen cell cultures. Collectively, our data indicate that this association prevents EAE development.

As such, we compared the therapeutic potential of VitD and paricalcitol (Pari), which is a non-hypercalcemic vitamin D analog, to control EAE. From the seventh day on after EAE induction, mice were injected with VitD or Pari every other day. VitD, but not Pari, displayed downmodulatory ability being able to reduce the recruitment of inflammatory cells, the mRNA expression of inflammatory parameters, and demyelination at the CNS. Lower production of proinflammatory cytokines by lymph node-derived cells and IL-17 by gut explants, and reduced intestinal inflammation were detected in the EAE/VitD group compared to the EAE untreated or Pari groups.

Furthermore, we observed the accumulation of a novel subset of GM-CSF-producing CD11b+CD4+ T cells in the CNS throughout disease progression. Importantly, early therapeutic anti-VLA-4 mAb treatment suppressed the accumulation of these GM-CSF-producing CD11b+CD4+ T cells in the CNS along with activated microglia/macrophages populations, and also conferred a protective effect against inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration, including demyelination and axonal loss.

Fourteen genes were selectively influenced by Atorvastatin in EAE mice. They are mainly related to immune cell functions and regulation of cell-to-cell interaction. Interestingly, seven genes were also differentially regulated in CFA-injected control mice. But qualitative and quantitative differences to EAE mice argue for a dependency of statin effects on the activation status of target cells. Differential regulation of the newly detected candidate genes of statin effects COX-1 and HSP-105 and the previously known statin-responsive genes ICAM-1 and CD86 was confirmed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Flow cytometric analysis of lymph node cells revealed that the effect of Atorvastatin treatment in non-immunized healthy animals resembled the effect of immunization with PLP peptide regarding changes of T helper cells, activated B cells and macrophages. In EAE mice, these effects were partially reversed by Atorvastatin treatment. Monitoring of expression of the newly identified candidate genes and patterns of lymphocyte subpopulations might predict the responsiveness of multiple sclerosis patients to statin treatment. <c2><a9> 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of an immunomodulatory therapy (teriflunomide, Aubagio<c2><ae>) on changes of the CxBGTh loop in the Theiler's Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus, (TMEV) mouse model of MS. METHODS: Forty-eight (48) mice were infected with TMEV, treated with teriflunomide (24) or control vehicle (24) and followed for 39 weeks. Mice were examined with MRS and volumetric MRI scans (0, 8, 26, and 39 weeks) in the cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus, using a 9.4T scanner, and with behavioral tests (0, 4, 8, 12, 17, 26, and 39 weeks).

Data were considered as significant at the p<0.01 level and as a trend at p<0.05 level. RESULTS: In the thalamus, the teriflunomide arm exhibited trends toward decreased glutamate levels at 8 and 26 weeks compared to the control arm (p = 0.039 and p = 0.026), while the control arm exhibited a trend toward increased glutamate between 0 to 8 weeks (p = 0.045). In the basal ganglia, the teriflunomide arm exhibited a trend toward decreased glutamate earlier than the control arm, from 0 to 8 weeks (p = 0.011), resulting in decreased glutamate compared to the control arm at 8 weeks (p = 0.016).

Here, we identified a pathway for immune cells to traffic from the brain that is associated with the rostral migratory stream (RMS), which is a forebrain source of newly generated neurons. Evaluation of fluorescently labeled leukocyte migration in mice revealed that DCs travel via the RMS from the CNS to the cervical LNs (CxLNs), where they present antigen to T cells. Pharmacologic interruption of immune cell traffic with the mononuclear cell-sequestering drug fingolimod influenced anti-CNS T cell responses in the CxLNs and modulated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) severity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Fingolimod treatment also induced EAE in a disease-resistant transgenic mouse strain by altering DC-mediated Treg functions in CxLNs and disrupting CNS immune tolerance. These data describe an immune cell pathway that originates in the CNS and is capable of dampening anti-CNS immune responses in the periphery.

Methods: EAE was induced in C57BL/6 mice by immunization with myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant. The mice were administered with PBS or olive oil, intraperitoneally, in the control groups and vitamin D (200 ng every two days) in the treatment group, from day +3 to +30. At day 31, the mice were scarified and their spinal cords and brains were harvested. The expression of the IL-27 and IL-33 mRNA in the spinal cord was measured using real time-PCR. Results: In PBS- or olive oil-treated EAE mice the expression of IL-27 P28 mRNA was significantly lower than that in the healthy control group (p<0.002). In both PBS- and olive oil-treated EAE groups, the expression of IL-27 EBI3 mRNA was also lower than that observed in the healthy group, but the differences were not significant. In vitamin D-treated EAE group, the expression of IL-27 P28 and IL-27 EBI3 were significantly higher compared with the olive oil-treated EAE groups (p<0.002 and p<0.04, respectively). The expression of IL-33 was significantly higher in PBS-or olive oil-treated EAE groups compared with healthy mice (p<0.05 and p<0.02, respectively).

GA-treated monocytes were stimulated with Toll-like receptor ligands, then evaluated for activation of kinases and transcription factors involved in innate immunity, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. GA-treated mice were evaluated for cytokine secretion and susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. RESULTS: GA-mediated inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes occurred independently of MyD88 and nuclear factor-<ce><ba>B, but was blocked by TRIF deficiency. Furthermore, GA did not provide clinical benefit in TRIF-deficient mice. GA inhibited activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, an upstream regulator of activating transcription factor (ATF)-2, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1, which regulates IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Consequently, nuclear translocation of ATF-2 and IRF3, components of the IFN-<ce><b2> enhanceosome, was impaired. Consistent with these observations, GA inhibited production of IFN-<ce><b2> in vivo in WT mice, but did not modulate proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes from IFNAR1-deficient mice.

The underlying multifactorial anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective effect of GA is in the induction of reactive T cells that release immunomodulatory cytokines and neurotrophic factors at the injury site. These GA-induced cytokines and growth factors may have a direct effect on axon function. Building on previous findings that suggest a neuroprotective effect of GA, we assessed the therapeutic effects of GA on brain and spinal cord pathology and functional correlates using the chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. Therapeutic regimens were utilized based on promising prophylactic efficacy. More specifically, C57BL/6 mice were treated with 2 mg/mouse/day GA for 8 days beginning at various time points after EAE post-induction day 15, yielding a thorough, clinically relevant assessment of GA efficacy within the context of severe progressive disease. Therapeutic treatment with GA significantly decreased clinical scores and improved rotorod motor performance in EAE mice. These functional improvements were supported by an increase in myelinated axons and fewer amyloid precursor protein-positive axons in the spinal cords of GA-treated EAE mice.

The most important unmet need in MS is use of treatments that delay the progression of the disease. Leucine-rich repeat and Immunoglobulin-like domain containing NOGO receptor-interacting protein 1(LINGO-1) have been known as inhibitors of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated LINGO-1 antibody effects on remyelination and neurobehavioral deficit using cuprizone-induced demyelination. Animals were randomly divided into three groups (n = 10): (1) Control group; received the regular diet, (2) CPZ group; normal saline was injected intraperitoneally, and (3) Treatment group; LINGO-1 antibody (10 mg/kg) was injected IP once every six days for 3 weeks. We assessed the level of myelin basic protein (MBP), neurofilament heavy chain (NF200), and Brain-derived neuroprotective factor (BDNF) in the corpus callosum (CC) by immunostaining against MBP, NF200, and BDNF. RESULTS: We found decreased levels of MBP, NF200, and BDNF in demyelinated CC, and anti-LINGO-1 treatment improved demyelinated structures. Furthermore, motor impairment was measured by Open-field (OFT) and Balance beam tests. In the treatment group, motor impairment was significantly improved.

Treatments with estrogens have been shown to decrease the severity of EAE through anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Here we investigated whether treatment with an estrogen receptor <ce><b1> (ER<ce><b1>) ligand could recapitulate the estrogen-mediated protection in clinical EAE. We then went on to examine both anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective mechanisms. EAE was induced in wild-type, ER<ce><b1>-, or ER<ce><b2>-deficient mice, and each was treated with the highly selective ER<ce><b1> agonist, propyl pyrazole triol, to determine the effect on clinical outcomes, as well as on inflammatory and neurodegenerative changes. ER<ce><b1> ligand treatment ameliorated clinical disease in both wild-type and ER<ce><b1> knock-out mice, but not in ER<ce><b1> knock-out mice, thereby demonstrating that the ER<ce><b1> ligand maintained ER<ce><b1> selectivity in vivo during disease. ER<ce><b1> ligand treatment also induced favorable changes in autoantigen-specific cytokine production in the peripheral immune system [decreased TNF<ce><b1>, interferon-<ce><b3>, and interleukin-6, with increased interleukin-5] and decreased CNS white matter inflammation and demyelination.

Treatment with either estradiol or the ER<ce><b1> ligand significantly reduced this gray matter pathology. In conclusion, treatment with an ER<ce><b1> ligand is highly selective in vivo, mediating both anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in EAE.

GA, PE, and exosomes reduced clinical severity, the extent of spinal cord demyelination, and the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the spinal cord. The frequency of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells increased after treatment of EAE mice with GA, PE, and exosomes. The mRNA expression of the inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-17<c2><a0> and interferon-gamma), as well as miR-326 expression, decreased significantly in the EAE mice after treatment with GA and exosomes.

The metabolic processes of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis are further possible downstream targets. In healthy adult mice, high levels of dihydroorotate-dehydrogenase (DHODH) activity are measured in the central nervous system (CNS), and DHODH inhibition may cause indirect effects on reactive oxygen species production and NADPH oxidase (NOX) mediated oxidative stress, known to be key aspects of the inflammatory response of the CNS. However, little is known about the effect of teriflunomide on the dynamics of NOX activation in CNS cells and subsequent alterations of neuronal function in vivo. In this study, we employed fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) and phasor analysis of the endogeneous fluorescence of NAD(P)H (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) in the brain stem of mice to visualize the effect of teriflunomide on cellular metabolism. Furthermore, we simultaneously studied neuronal Ca(2+) signals in transgenic mice with a FRET-based Troponin C Ca(2+) sensor based (CerTN L15) quantified using FRET-FLIM. Hence, we directly correlated neuronal (dys-)function indicated by steadily elevated calcium levels with metabolic activity in neurons and surrounding CNS tissue. Employing our intravital co-registered imaging approach, we could not detect any significant alteration of NOX activation after incubation of the tissue with teriflunomide. Furthermore, we could not detect any changes of the inflammatory induced neuronal dysfunction due to local treatment with teriflunomide. Concerning drug safety, we can confirm that teriflunomide has no metabolic effects on neuronal function in the CNS tissue during neuroinflammation at concentrations expected in orally treated patients.

Currently approved treatments have several shortcomings. Consequently, new and effective treatments with improved safety and convenience profiles are sought after by patients. OBJECTIVE: To explore the overall profile of vidofludimus for the treatment of RRMS. METHODS: Preclinical investigations were done exploring the species-dependency of DHODH inhibition of vidofludimus. In addition, the preclinical efficacy in a rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model and the inhibition of cytokine release from activated PBMC were investigated. Pharmacokinetic data were also obtained in a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose trial of the formulation IMU-838 (vidofludimus calcium). RESULTS: It was shown that vidofludimus is 2.6 times more potent in inhibiting DHO oxidation by human DHODH compared to teriflunomide. Although both compounds increased cell apoptosis, vidofludimus was more efficacious in the inhibition of T-lymphocyte proliferation compared to teriflunomide. The same was also observed for the secretion of IL-17 and IFN-<ce><b3>. Interestingly, the potency or vidofludimus to inhibit rat or mouse DHODH is 7.5 and 64.4 time lower than the for the human DHODH, respectively. The rat EAE study clearly exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of cumulative disease scores by vidofludimus. In the multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial, the serum half-life of about 30<c2><a0>h provides a favorable profile for once daily dosing of IMU-838, with quick dosing to steady state through levels within 5 days and the ability to wash out drug quickly, if required. CONCLUSIONS: The investigations highlighted that the desired selective immunomodulatory properties can be separated from general antiproliferative effects seen and related adverse events in first-generation DHODH inhibitors. Based on data obtained from a series of pre-clinical as well as phase 1 and phase 2 studies, IMU-838 is a promising next-generation candidate for the oral treatment of RRMS.

The vitamin D receptor-mediated increase in Smad3 expression partially explains the IL10 augmentation seen in Th17 cells. Furthermore, the VDR axis also modulates non-Smad signaling by activating ERK during differentiation of Th17 cells, which inhibits the Th17-specific genes il17a, il17f, il22, and il23r.

This hypothesis provided the impetus for the experiments reported here investigating mechanisms whereby 1,25-(OH)2D3 may inhibit murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Severe EAE was induced, 1,25-(OH)2D3 or mock treatment was administered, and clinical disease, histopathological disease, and encephalitogenic cells in the central nervous system (CNS) were analyzed within 24-72 h of the treatment. The mock-treated mice remained paralyzed (stage 3 EAE) while most hormone-treated animals regained the partial use of both hind limbs (stage 2 EAE) within 72 h of treatment. A histopathological examination showed the hormone-treated mice had a 50% decrease in white matter and meningeal inflammation at 72 h post treatment. A flow cytometric analysis of cell surface markers on spinal cord cells recovered 24 h post treatment showed the mock-treated mice with EAE had about 7.0 +/- 2.3 million Mac-1+ cells/cord, whereas the hormone-treated mice had about 2.1 +/- 2.6 million Mac-1+ cells/cord, which was not significantly different from the unmanipulated control mice. Otherwise, the flow cytometric analysis detected no significant differences between the groups with respect to CD4+ or CD8+ T cells or B cells or macrophages in draining lymph nodes or spinal cords. These results are discussed with regard to possible fates for the 5 million Mac-1+ cells that were rapidly lost from the inflamed CNS in the 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated mice, and the possible beneficial effect of hormone treatment in resolving acute MS.",10.1016/s0165-5728(99)00247-7,no,NA,WZ,1,NA,EAE,mouse,B10.PL,both,7,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,2,2.1,8,0.4,2.9,7,0.4,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Failed,NA

MS prevalence decreases with increasing sunlight exposure, supporting our hypothesis that the sunlight-dependent hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)) is a natural inhibitor of autoimmune T cell responses in MS. We found that vitamin D(3) inhibited experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in intact female mice, but not in ovariectomized females or males. To learn whether 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) is essential for vitamin D(3)-mediated protection, ovariectomized female mice were given E(2) or placebo and evaluated for vitamin D(3)-mediated EAE resistance. Diestrus-level E(2) implants alone provided no benefit, but they restored vitamin D(3)-mediated EAE resistance in the ovariectomized females.

In males, E(2) implants did not enable vitamin D(3) to inhibit EAE. The finding that vitamin D(3)-mediated protection in EAE is female-specific and E(2)-dependent suggests that declining vitamin D(3) supplies due to sun avoidance might be contributing to the rapidly increasing female gender bias in MS.

We observed a significant clinical improvement in 1,25-D3-treated rats. This effect was accompanied by a profound inhibition of CD4 antigen expression by central nervous system (CNS) infiltrating monocytes/macrophages and parenchymal microglia. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis performed at the time of the second attack evidenced a region-specific distribution of inflammatory cells. In the same way, some aspects of the effects exerted by 1,25-D3 appeared to vary depending on the region considered, namely spinal cord, brainstem, cerebellum, midbrain or anterior brain. Thus, in 1,25-D3-treated rats, we observed an almost complete inhibition of CD4 antigen expression in the granule cell layer and the adjacent white matter of the cerebellum as well as a marked decrease in the number of OX42-positive cells (macrophages and activated microglia) in anterior brain sections.

In the present study, we attempted to treat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by administration of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for MMP-2, MMP-9, and minocycline, all of which have MMP-inhibiting functions. Minocycline, but not siRNAs, significantly suppressed disease development. In situ zymography revealed that gelatinase activities were almost completely suppressed in the spinal cords of minocycline-treated animals, while significant gelatinase activities were measured in the EAE lesions of control animals. However, MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNAs and proteins in the spinal cords of treated rats were unexpectedly upregulated. At the same time, mRNA for tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMP)-1 and -2 were also upregulated. The EnzChek Gelatinase/Collagenase assay using tissue containing native MMPs and TIMPs demonstrated that gelatinase activity levels in the spinal cords of treated rats were suppressed to the same level as those in normal spinal cord tissues. Finally, double immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that MMP-9 immunoreactivities of treated rats were almost the same as those of control rats and that MMP-9 and TIMP-1 immunoreactivities were colocalized in the spinal cord. These findings suggest that minocycline administration does not suppress MMPs at mRNA and protein levels but that it suppresses gelatinase activities by upregulating TIMPs.

Microglia play a critical role in major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II)-dependent antigen presentation and in reactivation of CNS-infiltrated encephalitogenic T cells. Minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, has profound anti-inflammatory properties and is experimentally used for treatment of many CNS disorders; however, the mechanisms involved in minocycline effects remain unknown. We show that administration of minocycline for 2 weeks ameliorated clinical severity of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, an effect that partially involves the down-regulation of MHC II proteins in the spinal cord. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of minocycline inhibitory effects on MHC II expression in microglia. Although complex, the co-activator class II transactivator (CIITA) is a key regulator of MHC II expression. Here we show that minocycline inhibited interferon <ce><b3> (IFN<ce><b3>)-induced CIITA and MHC II mRNA. Interestingly, however, it was without effect on STAT1 phosphorylation or IRF-1 expression, transcription factors that are activated by IFN<ce><b3> and necessary for CIITA expression. Further experiments revealed that MHC II expression is down-regulated in the presence of the PKC<ce><b1> inhibitor G<c3><b6>6976. Minocycline inhibited IFN<ce><b3>-induced PKC <ce><b1>/<ce><b2>II phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of both PKC<ce><b1>/<ce><b2>II and IRF-1 that subsequently inhibits CIITA expression. Our present data delineate a molecular pathway of minocycline action that includes inhibitory effects on PKC<ce><b1>/<ce><b2>II and transcription factors that regulate the expression of critical inflammatory genes such as MHC II. Such a fundamental mechanism may underlie the pleiotropic effects of minocycline in CNS inflammatory disorders. <c2><a9> 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",10.1074/jbc.M611907200,no,NA,WZ,1,NA,EAE,rat,"Dark Agouti, Sprague-Dawley",female,NA,Minocycline,control,1,NA,2,0.6,NA,0.6,2.7,NA,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Clinical scores are from Dark Agouti rats,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,rat,Failed,NA

Short-term IFN-<ce><b1>/<ce><b2> treatment increased the percent of remyelinated spinal cord white matter by threefold when compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) treatment (P < 0.02), but it did not affect the extent of demyelination. In contrast, long-term IFN- <ce><b1>/<ce><b2> treatment increased the extent of demyelination by twofold (P < 0.03). Long-term treatment increased the absolute area of remyelination, but the percent remyelination as a function of area of demyelination was not changed because of increased demyelination. An immunomodulatory mechanism may have contributed to the effect of IFN-<ce><b1>/<ce><b2> on white matter pathology because treated mice had higher anti-TMEV IgGs in serum and demonstrated decreased numbers of B and T lymphocytes infiltrating the central nervous system (CNS). There was no correlation between the level of anti- IFN-<ce><b1>/<ce><b2> antibodies and the extent of demyelination or remyelination.

Nonetheless, FTY720-treated patients are more susceptible to viral infections, indicating a CD8 T-cell defect. Thus, the effects of FTY720 on CD8 T-cells were investigated. To this end, we utilized experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and a murine influenza model. CD8 T-cell trafficking, IFN<ce><b3> and Granzyme B (GrB) production were assessed by flow cytometry. CD8 T-cell cytotoxic function was assessed in vitro by an LDH release assay. FTY720 not only ameliorated EAE by sequestering T-cells, but also reduced IFN<ce><b3> and Granzyme B (GrB) in splenic CD8 T-cells. Murine influenza infection was exacerbated and mortality was increased, as FTY720 inhibited CD8 T-cell GrB production and lung infiltration. Remarkably, only the unphosphorylated compound was able to reduce IFN<ce><b3> and GrB levels in CD8 T-cells and inhibits their cytotoxic function in vitro. The phosphorylated moiety had no effect in vitro, indicating that CD8 T-cell suppression by FTY720 is independent of S1PR modulation. The addition of arachidonic acid rescued CD8 T-cell function, suggesting that this effect may be mediated via inhibition of cytosolic phospholipase A2. Herein, we demonstrate that FTY720 suppresses CD8 T-cells independently of its trafficking effects and S1PR modulation.

Most patients harbor pathogenic autoantibodies, the so-called NMO-IgGs, which are directed against the water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4) on astrocytes. When these antibodies gain access to the CNS, they mediate astrocyte destruction by complement-dependent and by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In contrast to multiple sclerosis (MS) patients who benefit from therapies involving type I interferons (I-IFN), NMO patients typically do not profit from such treatments. How is I-IFN involved in NMO pathogenesis? To address this question, we made gene expression profiles of spinal cords from Lewis rat models of experimental neuromyelitis optica (ENMO) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found an upregulation of I-IFN signature genes in EAE spinal cords, and a further upregulation of these genes in ENMO. To learn whether the local I-IFN signature is harmful or beneficial, we induced ENMO by transfer of CNS antigen-specific T cells and NMO-IgG, and treated the animals with I-IFN at the very onset of clinical symptoms, when the blood-brain barrier was open. With this treatment regimen, we could amplify possible effects of the I-IFN induced genes on the transmigration of infiltrating cells through the blood brain barrier, and on lesion formation and expansion, but could avoid effects of I-IFN on the differentiation of pathogenic T and B cells in the lymph nodes. We observed that I-IFN treated ENMO rats had spinal cord lesions with fewer T cells, macrophages/activated microglia and activated neutrophils, and less astrocyte damage than their vehicle treated counterparts, suggesting beneficial effects of I-IFN.",10.1371/journal.pone.0151244,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,NA,7.5,Interferon Beta 1,control,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,rat,Marketed,NA

Epidemiological evidence has suggested a role for virus infection in the initiation and/or exacerbation of MS. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced demyelinating disease serves as a relevant mouse model for MS. TMEV-infected mice develop a demyelinating disease with clinical symptoms beginning around 35 days after infection, which is associated with development of myelin-specific, PLP139-151, CD4+ T cell responses. Viruses have been suggested to initiate autoimmune disease through bystander activation of immune cells or through bystander damage to tissue during infection. We examined the effect of the innate immune response on development of autoimmune demyelinating disease by altering the innate immune response through administration of innate immune cytokines, IFN-<ce><b1> or IFN-<ce><b2>, or antiserum against the type I IFNs during the innate immune response to TMEV. Administration of IFN-<ce><b2>, but not IFN-<ce><b1>, to TMEV- infected mice led to reduced myelin-specific CD4+ T cell responses and reduced demyelinating disease, which was associated with decreased immune cell infiltration into the CNS and increased expression of IL-10 in the CNS. Conversely, administration of antiserum to IFN-<ce><b2> led to a more severe demyelinating disease. In addition, administration of poly(I:C), which is an innate immune agonist, to TMEV-infected mice during the innate immune response resulted in decreased myelin-specific CD4+ T cell responses and reduced demyelinating disease. These results demonstrate that activating or enhancing the innate immune response can reduce the subsequent initiation and progression of the autoimmune response and demyelinating disease. <c2><a9> 2009 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.",10.4049/jimmunol.0801940,no,NA,PH,1,NA,TMEV-IDD,mouse,SJL,female,5.5,Interferon Beta 1,control,1,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,BeAn- Strain of TMEV,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

Both vitamin D(3) and 1, 25-dihydroxyviatmin-D(3) (calcitriol) had beneficial effects in EAE/MS. However, the exact cause of vitamin D deficiency in EAE/MS is not clear. Previously, we documented that lovastatin (LOV) provides protection in EAE animals via inhibition of RhoA-ROCK signaling. Herein, we demonstrate that LOV prevents the lowering of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin-D(3) and 1,25-dihydroxyviatmin-D(3) levels including 1,25-dihydroxyviatmin-D(3) levels in the peripheral lymphoid organs and CNS of treated EAE animals. These effects of LOV were attributed to enhanced expression of vitamin D synthesizing enzyme (1<ce><b1>-hydroxylase) in kidney and the CNS, with corresponding reduction of vitamin D catabolizing enzyme (24-hydorxylase) expression in the CNS of EAE animals via inhibition of RhoA-ROCK signaling. Ex vivo and in vitro studies established that autoreactive Th1/Th17 cells had higher expression of 24-hydroxylase than Th2/T regulatory cells, that was reverted by LOV or ROCK inhibitor. Interestingly, LOV-mediated regulation of vitamin D metabolism had improved vitamin D(3) efficacy to confer protection in EAE animals and that was ascribed to the LOV- and calcitriol-induced immunomodulatory synergy. Together, these data provide evidence that interfering with RhoA-ROCK signaling in autoreactive Th1/Th17 cells can improve vitamin D(3) efficacy in clinical trials of MS and related neurodegenerative disorders.",10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.05.028,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,female,NA,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,2,1.2,11,0.2,2.2,11,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,rat,Failed,NA

We postulated that MMF exerts neuroprotective effects through modulation of microglia activation, a critical component of the neuroinflammatory cascade that occurs in neurodegenerative diseases such as MS. To ascertain our hypothesis and define the mechanistic pathways involved in the modulating effect of fumarates, we used real-time PCR and biochemical assays to assess changes in the molecular and functional phenotype of microglia, quantitative Western blotting to monitor activation of postulated pathway components, and ex vivo whole-cell patch clamp recording of excitatory post-synaptic currents in corticostriatal slices from mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for MS, to study synaptic transmission. We show that exposure to MMF switches the molecular and functional phenotype of activated microglia from classically activated, pro-inflammatory type to alternatively activated, neuroprotective one, through activation of the hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2). We validate a downstream pathway mediated through the AMPK-Sirt1 axis resulting in deacetylation, and thereby inhibition, of NF-<ce><ba>B and, consequently, of secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules. We demonstrate through ex vivo monitoring of spontaneous glutamate-mediated excitatory post-synaptic currents of single neurons in corticostriatal slices from EAE mice that the neuroprotective effect of DMF was exerted on neurons at pre-synaptic terminals by modulating glutamate release. By exposing control slices to untreated and MMF-treated activated microglia, we confirm the modulating effect of MMF on microglia function and, thereby, its indirect neuroprotective effect at post-synaptic level. These findings, whereby DMF-induced activation of a new HCAR2-dependent pathway on microglia leads to the modulation of neuroinflammation and restores synaptic alterations occurring in EAE, represent a possible novel mechanism of action for DMF in MS.",10.1007/s00401-015-1422-3,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Dimethyl fumarate,control,1,NA,2,2,20,0.1,3,20,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

Possible Implications for the Inflammatory Response","Monomethyl fumarate (MMF), metabolite of dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an immunosuppressive drug approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), is a potent agonist for hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2), eliciting signals that dampen cell activation or lead to inflammation such as the skin flushing reaction that is one of the main side effects of the treatment, together with gastrointestinal inflammation. Our aim is to further understand the molecular basis underlying these differential effects of the drug. We have used wild-type and HCAR2 knock-out mice to investigate, in vitro and ex vivo under steady-state and pathological conditions, the HCAR2-mediated signaling pathways activated by MMF in dendritic cells (DC), which promote differentiation of T cells, and in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) where activation of a pro-inflammatory pathway, such as the cyclooxygenase-2 pathway involved in skin flushing, could underlie gastrointestinal side effects of the drug. To understand how DMF treatment might impact on gut inflammation induced by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model for MS, we have used 3D X-ray phase contrast tomography and flow cytometry to monitor possible intestinal alterations at morphological and immunological levels, respectively. We show that HCAR2 is a pleiotropically linked receptor for MMF, mediating activation of different pathways leading to different outcomes in different cell types, depending on experimental in-vitro and in-vivo conditions. In the small intestine of EAE-affected mice, DMF treatment affected migration of tolerogenic DC from lamina propria to mesenteric lymph nodes, and/or reverted their profile to pro-inflammatory, probably as a result of reduced expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase and transforming growth factor beta as well as the inflammatory environment. Nevertheless, DMF treatment did not amplify the morphological alterations induced by EAE. On the basis of our further understanding of MMF signaling through HCAR2, we suggest that the pleiotropic signaling of fumarate via HCAR2 should be addressed for its pharmaceutical relevance in devising new lead compounds with reduced inflammatory side effects.",10.3389/fimmu.2021.655212,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Dimethyl fumarate,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

Cell viability was not significantly affected by this treatment. However, when concentrations of IFNgamma and/or TNFalpha having no deleterious effects per se on cell viability were added together with cuprizone, cell viability decreased significantly. In mitochondria isolated from cuprizone-treated glial cells, we observed a marked decrease in the activities of the various complexes of the respiratory chain, indicating a disruption of mitochondrial function. An enhancement in oxidant production was also observed in cuprizone and/or TNFalpha-treated oligodendroglial cells. In in vivo experiments, inhibition of microglial activation with minocycline prevented cuprizone-induced demyelination.

In support of the hypothesis that vitamin D3 may reduce MS risk and severity, we found that vitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) inhibited induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an MS model. To investigate how 1,25-(OH)2D3 could carry out anti-inflammatory functions, we administered 1,25-(OH)2D3 or a placebo to mice with EAE, and subsequently analyzed clinical disease, chemokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and recruitment of dye-labeled monocytes. The 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment significantly reduced clinical EAE severity within 3 days. Sharp declines in chemokines, inducible iNOS, and CD11b+ monocyte recruitment into the central nervous system (CNS) preceded this clinical disease abatement in the 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated animals. The 1,25-(OH)2D3 did not directly and rapidly inhibit chemokine synthesis in vivo or in vitro. Rather, the 1,25-(OH)2D3 rapidly stimulated activated CD4+ T cell apoptosis in the CNS and spleen. Collectively, these results support a model wherein inflammation stimulates a natural anti-inflammatory feedback loop. The activated inflammatory cells produce 1,25-(OH)2D3, and this hormone subsequently enhances the apoptotic death of inflammatory CD4+ T cells, removing the driving force for continued inflammation. In this way, the sunlight-derived hormone could reduce the risk of chronic CNS inflammation and autoimmune-mediated neurodegenerative disease.",10.1002/jnr.21382,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,B10.PL,NA,NA,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Failed,NA

Elevated levels of a critical inhibitor of the mammalian fibrinolitic system, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) have been demonstrated in human and animal models of MS. In experimental studies that resemble neuroinflammatory disease, PAI-1 deficient mice display preserved neurological structure and function compared to wild type mice, suggesting a link between the fibrinolytic pathway and MS. We previously identified a series of PAI-1 inhibitors on the basis of the 3-dimensional structure of PAI-1 and on virtual screening. These compounds have been reported to provide a number of in vitro and in vivo benefits but none was tested in CNS disease models because of their limited capacity to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The existing candidates were therefore optimized to obtain CNS-penetrant compounds. We performed an in vitro screening using a model of BBB and were able to identify a novel, low molecular PAI-1 inhibitor, TM5484, with the highest penetration ratio among all other candidates. Next, we tested the effects on inflammation and demyelination in an experimental allergic encephalomyelitis mice model. Results were compared to either fingolimod or 6<ce><b1>-methylprednisolone. Oral administration of TM5484 from the onset of signs, ameliorates paralysis, attenuated demyelination, and axonal degeneration in the spinal cord of mice. Furthermore, it modulated the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which plays a protective role in neurons against various pathological insults, and choline acetyltransferase, a marker of neuronal density.

C-Pc (2, 4 or 8 mg/kg i.p.) or IFN-beta (2000 IU, s.c.) was administered daily once a day or every other day, respectively, starting at disease onset, which differ among EAE mice between 11 and 15 days postinduction. Histological and immunohistochemistry (anti-Mac-3, anti-CD3 and anti-APP) assessments were performed in spinal cord in the postinduction time. Global gene expression in the brain was analyzed with the Illumina Mouse WG-6_V2 BeadChip microarray and the expression of particular genes, assessed by qPCR using the Fast SYBR Green RT-PCR Master Mix. Oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde, peroxidation potential, CAT/SOD ratio and GSH) were determined spectrophoto-metrically. Results showed that C-Pc ameliorates the clinical deterioration of animals, an effect that expresses the reduction of the inflammatory infiltrates invading the spinal cord tissue, the axonal preservation and the down-regulation of IL-17 expression in brain tissue and serum. C-Pc and IFN-beta improved the redox status in mice subjected to EAE, while microarray analysis showed that both treatments shared a common subset of differentially expressed genes, although they also differentially modulated another subset of genes.

Blocking LINGO-1 function leads to robust remyelination. The anti-LINGO-1 Li81 antibody is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for multiple sclerosis (MS) and is the first MS therapy that directly targets myelin repair. LINGO-1 is selectively expressed in brain and spinal cord but not in peripheral tissues. Perhaps the greatest concern for Li81 therapy is the limited access of the drug to the CNS. Here, we measured Li81 concentrations in brain, spinal cord, and cerebral spinal fluid in rats after systemic administration and correlated them with dose-efficacy responses in rat lysolecithin and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis spinal cord models of remyelination. Remyelination was dose-dependent, and levels of Li81 in spinal cord that promoted myelination correlated well with affinity measurements for the binding of Li81 to LINGO-1. Observed Li81 concentrations in the CNS of 0.1 to 0.4% of blood levels are consistent with values reported for other antibodies. To understand the features of the antibody that affect CNS penetration, we also evaluated the pharmacokinetics of Li81 Fab2, Fab, and poly(ethylene glycol)-modified Fab. The reagents all showed similar CNS exposure despite large differences in their sizes, serum half-lives, and volumes of distribution, and area under the curve (AUC) measurements in the CNS directly correlated with AUC measurements in serum.

The present studies were designed to test whether the loss of tolerance to myelin basic protein (MBP) requires costimulation by members of the B7 receptor family. CTLA-4Ig, a fusion protein ligand for B7-1 and B7-2, was used to assess the role of B7-mediated costimulation in chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by the transfer of MBP specific T cell lines. In adoptively transferred EAE, administering CTLA-4Ig to donor mice or during in vitro activation of MBP specific-T cells resulted in diminution of clinical disease. The presence of CTLA-4Ig during both the immunization and in vitro activation stages was most effective in preventing clinical signs of disease. This diminution in clinical disease was paralleled by a decreased proliferative response and reduced production of IL-2 and IL-4, but not IFN-gamma, after antigenic stimulation of encephalitogenic T cells in vitro. In contrast, CTLA-4Ig treatment of recipient animals after the transfer of MBP-activated T cells affected neither disease course nor severity. These results indicate that additional costimulatory pathways may be involved in established EAE, or that some cells are independent of costimulation or, alternatively, that CTLA-4Ig does not enter brain parenchyma in therapeutic concentrations.

We thus investigated whether memory impairment encountered at the early stage of the disease could be explained by a differential vulnerability of particular hippocampal subfields. By using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, we identified that early memory impairment was associated with selective alteration of the dentate gyrus as pinpointed in vivo with diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI). Neuromorphometric analyses and electrophysiological recordings confirmed dendritic degeneration, alteration in glutamatergic synaptic transmission and impaired long-term synaptic potentiation selectively in the dentate gyrus, but not in CA1, together with a more severe pattern of microglial activation in this subfield. Systemic injections of the microglial inhibitor minocycline prevented DTI, morphological, electrophysiological and behavioral impairments in EAE-mice. Furthermore, daily infusions of minocycline specifically within the dentate gyrus were sufficient to prevent memory impairment in EAE-mice while infusions of minocycline within CA1 were inefficient. We conclude that early memory impairment in EAE is due to a selective disruption of the dentate gyrus associated with microglia activation.

The exact mechanism of action by which teriflunomide exerts these effects is currently unknown. We assessed the effect of teriflunomide on brain glial cells in the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) by using a histological approach in combination with neuroimaging. METHODS: Forty-eight SJL female mice received an intracerebral injection of TMEV at 6-8 weeks of age and were then treated with teriflunomide (n = 24) or placebo (n = 24) for 9 months. They were examined with MRI and behavioral testing at 2, 6, and 9 months postinduction (mPI). Of those, 18 teriflunomide-treated and 17 controls mice were analyzed histologically at 9 mPI to sample from different brain regions for myelination status, microglial density, and oligodendroglial lineage. The histological and MRI outcomes were correlated. RESULTS: Corpus callosum microglial density was numerically lower in the teriflunomide-treated mice compared to the control group (141.1 <c2><b1> 21.7 SEM vs. 214.74 <c2><b1> 34.79 SEM, Iba1(+) cells/mm(2) , P = .087).

To assess the role of intracytoplasmic estrogen receptors in mediating suppression of EAE, we studied mice with disrupted estrogen receptor-(Esr1) and -<ce><b2> (Esr2) genes. We demonstrate that the protective effect of E2 is abrogated in B6.129-Esr1tm1Unc mice (Esr1-/-) but not in B6.129-Esr2 tm1Unc mice (Esr2-/-). The loss of E2-mediated protection from EAE in Esr1-/- mice immunized with the encephalitogenic MOG-35-55 peptide was manifested phenotypically by the development of severe acute clinical signs and histopathological lesions even in the presence of moderately high serum E2 levels. This is in contrast to C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice and Esr2-/- mice in which E2 treatment resulted in comparable serum levels and markedly suppressed clinical signs of EAE and abolished inflammatory lesions in the CNS. This pattern showing a lack of E2-dependent inhibition of EAE in Esr1-/- mice was mirrored by an enhanced rather than a reduced secretion of TNF-<ce><b1>, IFN-<ce><b1>, and interleukin (IL)-6 in MOG-specific splenocytes and a lack of inhibition of message for inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and chemokine receptors in CNS tissue.

In view of the complex pathogenesis and the relapsing and progressive nature of MS, combination therapy, a classical approach to treat many chronic diseases, could improve disease control over monotherapy. Ponesimod, a selective and rapidly reversible sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor Type 1 (S1P1) modulator, currently in Phase III clinical trial stage in relapsing MS (RMS), and dimethyl fumarate (DMF) would potentially be an ideal combination due to their differing mechanisms of action and oral administration. Objective: The goal of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of ponesimod monotherapy and investigate the potential additive, or synergistic, activity of ponesimod-DMF combination therapy in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal models of MS. Methods: Efficacy was evaluated in the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE model in C57BL/6 mice (ponesimod monotherapy) and in the myelin basic protein (MBP)-induced EAE model in Lewis rats (monotherapies and combination therapy). The principal readout was the clinical score assessing paralysis. Additional readouts, such as histopathology, survival, and disease prevalence, were generated in parallel when applicable. Results: Ponesimod monotherapy in the mouse EAE model showed significant efficacy in both preventative and therapeutic settings. In the rat EAE model, ponesimod demonstrated significant dose-dependent efficacy on clinical scores, while DMF showed only modest activity. Combination therapy synergistically reduced the severity and prevalence of disease. Only the combination treatment of ponesimod and DMF fully suppressed clinical disease activity by the end of the study. Conclusion: The results support the potential therapeutic benefits of combining ponesimod with DMF to improve disease activity control in patients with MS.

MMPs are also involved in destruction of myelin sheaths, leading to axonal and neuronal loss. The aim of the present study was to assess whether natalizumab, a transmigration-inhibiting monoclonal antibody against <ce><b1>4<ce><b2>1 integrin, influences expression of MMPs and TIMPs in the central nervous system of mice with EAE. MMP-2 and MMP-9, their respective inhibitors TIMP-2 and TIMP-1 and laminin were assessed by quantitative immunohistochemistry in the spinal cord cryosections of C57BL/6 mice with EAE in the successive phases of the disease (onset, peak and chronic). The percentage of immunopositive areas were calculated in sections encompassing the whole spinal cord cross-sectional area occupied by the gray and white matter. Results obtained in animals administered with 5 mg/kg natalizumab were compared with those collected from control mice receiving 5 mg/kg IgG. Both studied MMPs and both TIMPs were upregulated in control EAE mice. Natalizumab treatment significantly reduced expression of MMPs and increased expression of TIMPs in the peak and chronic phases of the disease. This effect was accompanied by inhibition of laminin degradation in the vascular basal laminae and reduction of inflammatory infiltration. Results of this study demonstrate that in addition to its well known anti-integrin activity counteracting transmigration of immune cells into the central nervous system, natalizumab strengthens this effect by its probably indirect influence on MMPs and TIMPs leading to protection of blood-brain barrier integrity.",10.26402/jpp.2020.2.11,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,10.5,Natalizumab,control,1,40,2,1,5,0.1,2.7,5,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

There is still lack of effective treatments currently. Pien Tze Huang (PZH), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, has been proved to have anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and immunoregulatory effects. However, whether PZH can be used to treat MS is still obscure. This study aimed to investigate the possible therapeutic effect and the underlying action mechanism of PZH in relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (RR-EAE) mice. Female SJL/J mice were immunized with myelin proteolipid protein 139-151 (PLP(139-151)) and pertussis toxin to establish RR-EAE model. Mice were then randomly divided into normal group, model group, PZH group and positive control group (fingolimod, FTY-720), and drugs were orally administered for 60 days from the day 10 after immunization. Sera of mice were collected for ELISA detection. Tissues of CNS were harvested for hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) and luxol fast blue (LFB) staining. Furthermore, Th1, Th17 cells and their related cytokines in the CNS were detected by flow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively. Proteins involved in STAT and NF-<ce><ba>B signaling pathways were detected by western blot. The results showed that PZH-treated mice displayed mild or moderate clinical symptoms compared with untreated EAE mice that exhibited severe clinical symptoms. PZH remarkably reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and myelin damage in the CNS of EAE mice. It markedly down-regulated the levels of IFN-<ce><b3> and IL-17A in sera of EAE mice. Moreover, PZH could reduce the percentages of Th1 and Th17 cells. It also suppressed the production of transcription factors ROR-<ce><b3>t and T-bet as well as the mRNA levels of their downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-<ce><b3> and IL-17A. Furthermore, PZH could inhibit the phosphorylation of some key proteins in the STAT and NF-<ce><ba>B signaling pathways.

Here, the design and optimization of novel [1,2,4]oxadiazole derivatives as selective S1P receptor agonists are described.

The aim of the present study is to analyse the effects of MLT administration in comparison with the first-line treatments for MS (IFN-<ce><b2> and GA). METHODS: EAE was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats; the animals subsequently received either IFN-<ce><b2>, GA, or MLT. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were analysed by multiplex assay to determine the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. The neurological evaluation of EAE was also recorded.

METHODS: EAE was induced by subcutaneous immunization of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35-55) in 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice. During EAE induction, mice were separated to distinct groups and provided either BIO-1211 (5 and 10<e2><80><89>mg/kg) or NTZ (5<e2><80><89>mg/kg) and co-administration of these two compounds.

In a relapsing-remitting model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the neural stem cells (NSCs) become activated and initiate regeneration during acute disease, but lose this ability during the chronic phases of disease. We hypothesized that chronic microglia activation contributes to the failure of the NSC repair potential in the SVZ. METHODS: Using bromodeoxyuridine injections at different time points during EAE, we quantified the number of proliferating and differentiating progenitors, and evaluated the structure of the SVZ by electron microscopy. In vivo minocycline treatment during EAE was used to address the effect of microglia inactivation on SVZ dysfunction. RESULTS: In vivo treatment with minocycline, an inhibitor of microglia activation, increases stem cell proliferation in both naive and EAE animals. Minocycline treatment decreases cortical and periventricular pathology in the chronic phase of EAE, improving the proliferation of Sox2 stem cells and NG2 oligodendrocyte precursors cells originating in the SVZ and their differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes. INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that failure of repair observed during chronic EAE correlates with microglia activation and that treatments targeting chronic microglial activation have the potential for enhancing repair in the CNS.",10.1002/ana.22299,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SJL,NA,NA,Minocycline,control,1,NA,2,0.3,10,0.4,1.2,10,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Failed,NA

We have shown that MS patients have increased numbers of GM-CSF(+) Th cells in circulation, and that IFN-<ce><b2> therapy reduces their numbers. GM-CSF expression by myelin-specific Th cells is essential for the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. These findings suggested that IFN-<ce><b2> therapy may function via suppression of GM-CSF production by Th cells. In the current study, we elucidated a feedback loop between monocytes and Th cells that amplifies autoimmune neuroinflammation, and found that IFN-<ce><b2> therapy ameliorates central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity by inhibiting this proinflammatory loop. IFN-<ce><b2> suppressed GM-CSF production in Th cells indirectly by acting on monocytes, and IFN-<ce><b2> signaling in monocytes was required for EAE suppression.

Established therapies target primarily the inflammatory component of the disease, but fail to prevent neurodegeneration. Fingolimod (codenamed FTY720) is an oral sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator with promising results in phase II trials in multiple sclerosis patients and is under further development as a novel treatment for multiple sclerosis. To evaluate whether FTY720 has neuroprotective properties, we tested this drug in a rat model of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced optic neuritis. FTY720 exerted significant anti-inflammatory effects during optic neuritis and reduced inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage; however, FTY720 treatment did not prevent apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the neurons that form the axons of the optic nerve. Consistent with this lack of effect on RGC survival, FTY720 treatment did not improve visual function, nor did it prevent apoptosis of RGCs in vitro. We observed a persistent activation of apoptotic signaling pathways in RGCs under FTY720 treatment, a possible underlying mechanism for the lack of neuroprotection in the presence of strong anti-inflammatory effects, Furthermore, FTY720 shifted the remaining inflammation in the optic nerve toward neurotoxicity by modest up-regulation of potential neurotoxic cytokines.

In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), B cells are required for spontaneous recovery in acute models. Production of IL-10 by regulatory B cells has been shown to modulate the severity EAE and other autoimmune diseases. Previously, we suggested that B cells regulated the number of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells (Treg) in the CNS during EAE. Because Treg suppress autoimmune responses, we asked whether B cells control autoimmunity by maintenance of Treg numbers. B cell deficiency achieved either genetically (<ce><bc>MT) or by depletion with anti-CD20 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of peripheral but not thymic Treg. Adoptive transfer of WT B cells into <ce><bc>MT mice restored both Treg numbers and recovery from EAE. When we investigated the mechanism whereby B cells induce the proliferation of Treg and EAE recovery, we found that glucocorticoid-induced TNF ligand, but not IL-10, expression by B cells was required. Of clinical significance is the finding that anti-CD20 depletion of B cells accelerated spontaneous EAE and colitis.

Based on the modes of action of interferon-beta (IFN-<ce><b2>) and dimethyl fumarate (DMF), we hypothesized that anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects may synergize in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). METHODS: EAE was induced in C57BL/6 mice by immunization with MOG35-55-peptide. Murine IFN-<ce><b2> was injected s.c. every other day at 10.000IU, and DMF was provided at 15mg/kg by oral gavage twice daily. Control mice received PBS injections and were treated by oral gavage with the vehicle methylcellulose. Mice were scored daily by blinded observers and histological, FACS and cytokine studies were performed to further elucidate the underlying mechanism of action. RESULTS: Combination therapy significantly ameliorated EAE disease course in comparison to controls and monotherapy with IFN-<ce><b2>. Histological analyses showed a significant effect on axon preservation with almost twice as much axons present in inflamed lesions as compared to control. Remarkably, the effect on axonal preservation was more pronounced under combination therapy than with both monotherapies. Neither monotherapy nor combination therapy demonstrated modulation of cytokines and frequency of antigen presenting cells. DISCUSSION: Combination of IFN-<ce><b2> and DMF resulted in greater beneficial effects with improved tissue protection as compared to the respective monotherapies.

The cuprizone (CPZ) model for the CNS de/remyelination has gained a renewed interest during the past decade. CPZ-induced demyelination is considered to be primarily an oligodendrocyte loss with participation of the inflammatory response. As the blood brain barrier remains intact, we found this model advantageous for studying GA effects on CNS remyelination with minimum influence of the peripheral immune cellular component. Our results show that GA, given one week before the CPZ treatment, had a maturational effect functional to remyelination. However, myelin was unorganized as compared to controls. When GA was concomitantly injected with CPZ, oligodendroglial precursor proliferation diminished in favor of maturation and myelin recovered an organized disposition. GA-treated animals also show microglial cell (MG) activation. In vitro assays demonstrated that GA-primed MG cultures had a significant increase in IL-10 and IL-4 secretion.

Fingolimod is an effective orally active agent for the treatment of MS, affecting lymphocyte invasion of the brain. However, it is still unclear if fingolimod can be neuroprotective in this disorder. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Using neurophysiological recordings and morphological evaluation of dendritic integrity, we evaluated the effects of oral fingolimod on the clinical score of EAE mice in order to determine whether the compound was associated with preservation of synaptic transmission. KEY RESULTS Oral fingolimod prevented and reversed the pre- and postsynaptic alterations of glutamate transmission in EAE mice. These effects were associated with a clear amelioration of the clinical deterioration seen in EAE mice, and with a significant inhibition of neuronal dendritic pathology. Fingolimod did not alter the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in control animals, suggesting that only the pathological processes behind the inflammation-induced defects in glutamate transmission were modulated by this compound. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The beneficial effects of fingolimod on the clinical, synaptic and dendritic abnormalities of murine EAE might correlate with the neuroprotective actions of this agent, as observed in MS patients.

Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for the identification of disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic approaches for SPMS.

The anti-inflammatory effects of nasally administered interferon (IFN)-<ce><b2> are partly mediated by AHR. Dietary tryptophan is metabolized by the gut microbiota into AHR agonists that have an effect on astrocytes to limit CNS inflammation.

To date, little information is available on the effects of IFN-beta in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal correlate of the human disease MS. Therefore, we investigated the effects of recombinant rat IFN-beta (rrIFN-beta) on EAE in Lewis rats with emphasis on a treatment regimen during the paralytic phase of the disease. The results indicated that rrIFN-beta dose-dependently inhibited disease activity with complete prevention at a s.c. dose of 300,000 U/day, provided that treatment was continued for 3 wk. Discontinuation of treatment on day 17 postimmunization resulted in a protracted and relapsing disease course with strongly enhanced clinical severity. Detailed immunohistology of central nervous system (CNS) tissue of protected animals revealed an almost complete absence of CNS lesions and a >90% reduction in the number of infiltrating leukocytes. Accordingly, isolation of mononuclear cells from spinal cord tissue of successfully treated EAE rats revealed a reduction of approximately 95% in the number of cells that produce IFN-gamma in response to the encephalitogenic peptide MBP63-88. Furthermore, rrIFN-beta significantly enhanced serum corticosterone levels, which showed an inverse relationship with disease activity. We show that rrIFN-beta can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on disease activity dependent on the timing and the duration of treatment.

In this study, a nanoformulation containing rhMBP with RTX on its surface (Nano-rhMBP-RTX) was prepared and investigated in comparison with other treatment groups to determine its potential neuro-protective effects on C57BL/6 mice after inducing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). METHODS: EAE was induced in the corresponding mice by injecting 100 <ce><bc>L of an emulsion containing complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). The subjects were weighed, scored and subjected to behavioural tests. After reaching a clinical score of 3, various treatments were given to corresponding EAE-induced and non-induced groups including rhMBP, RTX, empty nanoparticle prepared by poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) or the prepared nanoformulation (Nano-rhMBP-RTX).

METHODS: We collected splenocytes and CD4(+) T cells from C57BL/6 wild-type and interferon (IFN)-<ce><b3>-deficient mice. For human PBMCs, venous blood was collected from healthy donors, and PBMCs were collected using the Percoll gradient method. Cells were cultured with anti-CD3/28 in the presence/absence of DF for 3 to 5 days. Cells were stained and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cytokines were measured by ELISA in cell supernatants. For in vivo experiments, EAE was induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein(35-55) and mice were treated with oral DF or vehicle daily. RESULTS: DF acts directly on CD4(+) T cells and suppresses GM-CSF-producing Th1 not Th17 or single GM-CSF(+) T cells in EAE. In addition, GM-CSF suppression depends on the IFN-<ce><b3> pathway. We also show that DF specifically suppresses Th1 and GM-CSF-producing Th1 cells in PBMCs from healthy donors.

In this study we describe a novel S1P1 agonist AKP-11, next generation of S1P1 agonist, with immunomodulatory activities in cell culture model and for therapeutic efficacy against an animal model of MS, i.e. experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) but without the adverse effects observed with FTY720. Like FTY720, AKP-11 bound to S1P1 is internalized and activates intracellular AKT and ERKs cellular signaling pathways. In contrast to FTY720, AKP-11 mediated S1P1 downregulation is independent of sphingosine kinase activity indicating it to be a direct agonist of S1P1. The S1P1 loss and inhibition of lymphocyte egress by FTY720 leads to lymphopenia. In comparison with FTY720, oral administration of AKP-11 caused milder and reversible lymphopenia while providing a similar degree of therapeutic efficacy in the EAE animal model. Consistent with the observed reversible lymphopenia with AKP-11, the S1P1 recycled back to cell membrane in AKP-11 treated cells following its withdrawal, but not with withdrawal of FTY720. Accordingly, a smaller degree of ubiquitination and proteolysis of S1P1 was observed in AKP-11 treated cells as compared to FTY720. Consistent with previous observations, FTY720 treatment is associated with adverse effects of bradycardia and lung vascular leaks in rodents, whereas AKP-11 treatment had undetectable effects on bradycardia and reduced lung vascular leaks as compared to FTY720. Taken together, the data documents that AKP-11 treatment cause milder and reversible lymphopenia with milder adverse effects while maintaining therapeutic efficacy similar to that observed with FTY720, thus indicating therapeutic potential of AKP-11 for treatment of MS and related autoimmune disorders.",10.1371/journal.pone.0141781,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Lewis,female,NA,Fingolimod,control,1,NA,2,0.9,6,0.2,2.9,6,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,age=adult,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,rat,Marketed,NA

Animals were treated with 3 x 10(5) units of recombinant rat IFN-beta s.c. once at 18 hr, or with 10 mg/kg methylprednisolone (MP) i.v. twice at 18 and 6 hr prior to dissection, or with a combination of both. T cell apoptosis was detected by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections of spinal cord, using morphological criteria and TUNEL staining. Double labeling of immune cells was done for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and metalloproteinase (MMP) 2. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was visualized by staining for albumin. In severe EAE, an increase of T cell apoptosis was seen after IFN-beta alone (all data presented as mean +/- SD: 24.5% +/- 2.2%, P < 0.05, vs. 19.4% +/- 3.1% in controls), and in combination with MP (29.4% +/- 7.3%, P < 0.05 vs. controls). Only the combination therapy decreased T cell infiltration (53.9 +/- 17.7 cells/mm(2), P < 0.05, vs. 99.5 +/- 35.2 cells/mm2 in controls).

The rate of TNF-alpha-expressing T cells was significantly decreased by IFN-beta and in combination with MP. Also, TNF-alpha expression in macrophages was significantly reduced by IFN-beta and by the combination therapy. The rate of MMP2-expressing macrophages was lower after IFN-beta but clearly decreased only in combination with MP. BBB disruption was ameliorated after IFN-beta but significantly only in combination with MP.

The compound is approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Cladribine can cross the blood-brain barrier, suggesting a potential effect on central nervous system (CNS) resident cells. Here, we explored compartment-specific immunosuppressive as well as potential direct neuroprotective effects of oral cladribine treatment in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. METHODS: In the current study, we compare immune cell frequencies and phenotypes in the periphery and CNS of EAE mice with distinct grey and white matter lesions (combined active and focal EAE) either orally treated with cladribine or vehicle, using flow cytometry. To evaluate potential direct neuroprotective effects, we assessed the integrity of the primary auditory cortex neuronal network by studying neuronal activity and spontaneous synaptic activity with electrophysiological techniques ex vivo. RESULTS: Oral cladribine treatment significantly attenuated clinical deficits in EAE mice. Ex vivo flow cytometry showed that cladribine administration led to peripheral immune cell depletion in a compartment-specific manner and reduced immune cell infiltration into the CNS. Histological evaluations revealed no significant differences for inflammatory lesion load following cladribine treatment compared to vehicle control. Single cell electrophysiology in acute brain slices was performed and showed an impact of cladribine treatment on intrinsic cellular firing patterns and spontaneous synaptic transmission in neurons of the primary auditory cortex. Here, cladribine administration in vivo partially restored cortical neuronal network function, reducing action potential firing. Both, the effect on immune cells and neuronal activity were transient.

DMF also modulated B-cell MHC II expression and reduced the incidence of clinical disease in a B-cell dependent model of spontaneous CNS autoimmunity.

In the present study, the possibility that glatiramer acetate (GA) treatment influences the MHC class I expression and the synaptic plasticity process in the spinal cord during the course of EAE was investigated. C57BL/6J mice were induced to EAE and submitted to treatment either with a placebo solution or with GA (0.05mg/animal, subcutaneously, on a daily basis). All the animals were sacrificed at the peak disease (14 days after induction) or at the point of recovery of the clinical signs (21 days after induction). The spinal cords were removed and submitted to immunohistochemical examination, Western blotting and transmission electron microscopy analysis. The results showed that GA treat-ment was able to decrease synaptic loss during the course of EAE, which correlates with the downregulation of the MHC I complex. The present results reinforce the neuroprotective role of GA treatment, by reducing synaptic loss during the course of the disease. Such action may be associated with the recently described role of MHC I regulation during the synaptic plasticity process. <c2><a9> Ivyspring International Publisher.",10.7150/ijbs.7.1188,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,70,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

Ozanimod profiling revealed a species difference in its potency for S1P(5) in mouse, rat, and canine compared with that for human and monkey. Site-directed mutagenesis identified amino acid alanine at position 120 to be responsible for loss of activity for mouse, rat, and canine S1P(5), and mutation back to threonine as in human/monkey S1P(5) restored activity. Radioligand binding analysis performed with mouse S1P(5) confirmed the potency loss is a consequence of a loss of affinity of ozanimod for mouse S1P(5) and was restored with mutation of alanine 120 to threonine. Study of ozanimod in preclinical mouse models of MS can now determine the S1P receptor(s) responsible for observed efficacies with receptor engagement as measured using pharmacokinetic exposures of free drug. Hence, in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, ozanimod exposures sufficient to engage S1P(1), but not S1P(5), resulted in reduced circulating lymphocytes, disease scores, and body weight loss; reduced inflammation, demyelination, and apoptotic cell counts in the spinal cord; and reduced circulating levels of the neuronal degeneration marker, neurofilament light. In the demyelinating cuprizone model, ozanimod prevented axonal degradation and myelin loss during toxin challenge but did not facilitate enhanced remyelination after intoxication. Since free drug levels in this model only engaged S1P(1,) we concluded that S1P(1) activation is neuroprotective but does not appear to affect remyelination. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Ozanimod, a selective modulator of human sphingisone 1-phosphate receptor subtypes 1 and 5 (S1P(1/5)), displays reduced potency for rodent and dog S1P(5) compared with human, which results from mutation of threonine to alanine at position 120. Ozanimod can thus be used as a selective S1P(1) agonist in mouse models of multiple sclerosis to define efficacies driven by S1P(1) but not S1P(5). Based on readouts for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and cuprizone intoxication, S1P(1) modulation is neuroprotective, but S1P(5) activity may be required for remyelination.",10.1124/jpet.121.000741,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,10,Ozanimod,control,1,NA,2,1.1,12,0.2,2.8,12,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"MR mri data was done in cuprizone model, but data not shown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

In this study the effects of EGCG on proteolipid protein (PLP) and oligodendrocyte transcription factor 1 (Olig1) expression in the cerebral cortex of a murine model of cuprizone-induced demyelination was investigated. C57BL/6 mice were treated with cuprizone for six weeks in order to induce demyelination. Immediately after the cessation of cuprizone the animals were divided into 6 groups (n = 10 for each group). The first two groups were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with EGCG in the amount of 50 mg/kg/daily body weight for 2 and 4 weeks. The second two groups (SHAM) were injected IP with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 and 4 weeks, and the third two groups were left without injection as controls. After two and four weeks the mice were killed and the cerebral cortex was collected and the expression of Plp and Olig1 was studied by real-time PCR. The results showed significant increases in PLP and Olig1 expression in the EGCG-treated groups as compared to the SHAM and control groups (p < 0.0001).

However, existing methods to score EAE disease severity are subjective and often vary between individual researchers, making it difficult to translate findings across different studies. An enhanced automated method of disease scoring would eliminate subjectivity and reduce operator-dependent errors. Here, we used an Infra-Red Activity Monitoring System (IRAMS) to measure murine locomotor activity as a surrogate measure of disease severity and compared it to standard EAE scoring methods. In mice immunized with CNS-specific myelin antigens, we observed an inverse correlation between disease severity and mouse activity, with the IRAMS showing enhanced disease scoring compared to standard EAE scoring methods. Relative to standard EAE scoring methods, IRAMS showed comparable measurement of disease relapses and remissions in the SJL/J-relapsing-remitting model of EAE, and could comparably assess the therapeutic efficiency of the MS drug, Copaxone (Glatiramer acetate-GA).

Thus, specific gut bacteria that are lower in abundance in MS patients could be used as a potential treatment option for this disease.

Both genetic and environmental factors have been shown to play an important role in MS. Among genetic factors, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II allele such as HLA-DR2, DR3, DR4, DQ6, and DQ8 show the association with the MS. We have previously used transgenic mice expressing MS susceptible HLA class II allele such as HLA-DR2, DR3, DQ6, and DQ8 to validate significance of HLA alleles in MS. Although environmental factors contribute to 2/3 of MS risk, less is known about them. Gut microbiota is emerging as an imporatnt environmental factor in MS pathogenesis. We and others have shown that MS patients have distinct gut microbiota compared to healthy control (HC) with a lower abundance of Prevotella.

The protective effects of FTY720 in EAE are primarily scored manually by examining weight loss and limb paralysis that begins around 10-12 days after immunisation. To our knowledge, pre-clinical effects of FTY720 on animal behaviour early in EAE have not been explored. Here, we developed an automated behaviour monitoring system to examine the early effects of FTY720 on subtle pre-symptomatic behaviour of mice induced with EAE. Our automated home-cage monitoring system (AHC-MS) enabled non-contact detection of movement and ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs) of mice induced with EAE, thus allowing detection of subtle changes in mouse behaviour before paralysis occurs. Mice receiving FTY720 emit longer USVs and display higher levels of motor activity than vehicle-treated EAE mice before clinical symptoms become apparent. Importantly, this study promotes the 3Rs ethics (replacement, reduction and refinement) in the EAE animal model and may also improve pre-screening of potentially novel MS therapies.

Among them is the monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab that depletes mainly B cells and T cells in the immune periphery.

METHODS: We used myelin basic protein (MBP)-proteolipid protein (PLP)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6 (B6) mice as B cell-dependent model of MS.

Effects on CNS infiltration and B cell aggregation were determined by immunohistochemistry. Neurodegeneration was evaluated by Luxol Fast Blue, SMI-32, and Olig2/APC staining as well as by electron microscopy and phosphorylated heavy neurofilament serum ELISA. RESULTS: Treatment with anti-CD52 antibody attenuated EAE only when administered at the peak of disease. While there was no effect on the production of MP4-specific IgG, the treatment almost completely depleted CNS infiltrates and B cell aggregates even when given as late as 60<c2><a0>days after onset.

Strategies to increase the level of these trophic molecules may facilitate repair in demyelinating conditions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Because leukocytes are a source of neurotrophic factors, and as glatiramer acetate (GA) generates T helper 2 (Th2) lymphocytes that are not known to be harmful, we tested the hypothesis that GA regulates oligodendrogenesis and myelin formation. First, we generated GA-reactive Th2 cells and determined that they produced transcripts for neurotrophic factors, including insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). The conditioned medium from GA-reactive T cells elevated IGF-1 protein and promoted the formation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) from embryonic brain-derived forebrain cells in culture. We next subjected mice to lysolecithin-induced demyelination of the spinal cord. At 7 days after the insult, the number of OPCs in the demyelinated dorsal column was higher than that in uninjured controls, and was further increased by the daily s.c. injection with GA. Increased OPC generation by GA was associated temporally with the elevation of IGF-1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the spinal cord. Finally, the resultant remyelination at 28 days was higher in mice treated with GA during the first 7 days of injury compared with vehicle controls.

Less clear has been the impact of vitamin D on the pro-inflammatory Th17 subset, and whether and how vitamin D may preferentially drive the polarization of one of the T helper subsets. METHODS: Using human peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells and mouse splenocytes and lymph node cells in culture, we examined whether and how vitamin D preferentially skews T cells towards the Th1, Th2 or Th17 subsets. Mice afflicted with the multiple sclerosis-like condition, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), were examined in vivo for the relevance of the tissue culture-derived results. RESULTS: We report that the biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 {1,25(OH)2D3}, consistently generates human and murine Th2 cells in culture, frequently leaving unchanged the levels of Th1/Th17 cytokines. As a result, the ratio of Th2 to Th1 and Th17 is increased by 1,25(OH)2D3. The upregulation of Th2 to Th1 or Th17 subsets by 1,25(OH)2D3 is enabled by an increase of the GATA-3 transcription factor, which itself is promoted upstream by an elevation of the STAT6 transcription factor. In mice, the alleviation of EAE severity by 1,25(OH)2D3 is accompanied by elevation of levels of GATA-3 and STAT6. Significantly, the efficacy of 1,25(OH)2D3 in ameliorating EAE is completely lost in mice genetically deficient for STAT6, which was accompanied by the inability of 1,25(OH)2D3 to raise GATA-3 in STAT6 null lymphocytes.

Activated T lymphocytes killed human neurons prominently within 24 hours but toxicity was significantly attenuated when T cells were exposed to 1,25D3 prior to the co-culture. In EAE, 1,25D3 treatment initiated from peak clinical severity reduced the extent of clinical disability and mitigated the progressive loss of axons. The reduction of axonal and neuronal loss by 1,25D3 in the context of an inflammatory assault to the central nervous system is a potential contributor to the putative benefits of vitamin D in MS.",10.1371/journal.pone.0144084,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,8.5,Vitamin D3,control,1,36,2,4.3,16,0.8,7.5,16,0.5,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Failed,NA

Here, we evaluated the potential of an agonist at this receptor, FTY720 (fingolimod), to activate the promyelinating pathways within the brain to encourage remyelination and neuroprotection. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In this study, we used the cuprizone model in male C57BL/6 mice and tested the promyelinating and neuroprotective effects of FTY720 after acute and chronic toxin-induced experimental demyelination. We used histological, immunohistochemical and gene expression methods. KEY RESULTS: The midline of the corpus callosum was severely demyelinated after acute and chronic cuprizone-induced demyelination. Robust endogenous remyelination was evident after acute, but impaired after chronic, demyelination. FTY720 treatment modestly accelerated myelin recovery after acute but not chronic cuprizone exposure. Markers of gliosis (astrocyte and microglia activation) were not affected by FTY720 treatment. Remarkably, the accumulation of amyloid precursor protein-positive spheroids in axons was less distinct in FTY720-treated animals, indicating that this compound alleviated ongoing axonal damage. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We show that even during endogenous remyelination, axonal degeneration continued at a low level, accumulating over time. This continuous neurodegenerative process was ameliorated by FTY720 treatment. FTY720 preserved CNS integrity by direct interaction with brain resident cells, the actions of which are still to be defined.",10.1111/bph.12938,no,NA,PH,1,NA,cuprizone,mouse,C57BL/6,male,8,Fingolimod,control,3,72,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,treatment during recovery after curprizone diet was ended,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

R.",2000,Brain,"Effects of 4-aminopyridine on demyelinated axons, synapses and muscle tension","Several clinical trials have demonstrated that 4-amino-pyridine (4-AP), a potassium channel-blocking agent, improves symptoms in some patients with multiple sclerosis. The beneficial effects have typically been attributed to the restoration of conduction to demyelinated axons, since this effect was previously demonstrated experimentally. However, the clinical dose is approximately 250-1000 times lower than that used experimentally, potentially making extrapolation of the experimental findings unreliable. To examine the action(s) of 4-AP in demyelinating disorders, the drug was administered at clinical doses, both in vivo and in vitro, to rat dorsal column axons which had been experimentally demyelinated by the intraspinal injection of ethidium bromide. 4-AP had no consistent effect in restoring conduction to demyelinated axons, even to axons which were held just on the verge of conducting by adjusting the lesion temperature. However, 4-AP had prominent effects that did not involve demyelinated axons, including the potentiation of synaptic transmission and an increase in skeletal muscle twitch tension. We propose that these latter effects may be largely responsible for the beneficial action of 4-AP in multiple sclerosis patients. If so, the dominant effects of 4-AP in multiple sclerosis patients are independent of demyelination, and it follows that 4-AP may be beneficial in other neurological disorders in which function is diminished.",10.1093/brain/123.1.171,no,NA,PH,1,NA,ethidium bromide,rat,"Sprague-Dawley, Wistar",male,NA,Fampridine,control,3,21,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,age=adult,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,rat,Marketed,NA

Cytokines belong to Th1 or Th2 family and inflammatory cells, play significant role in pathophysiology of MS. Thus, any treatment supposed to influence the relation between Th1 to Th2 cytokines expression. Although vitamin D has been prescribed as a therapeutic supplement of MS for a long time, it is not clear how much it may affect the Th1/Th2 ratio. To answer this question the present research was designed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty C57BL/6 adult female mice were used. The animals were randomly divided into trial and control groups. Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) modeling for MS and clinical scoring as cited by others was used. Based on scoring and step of the disease vitamin D3 prescription (5 mg/kg) started and continued for three weeks. RESULTS: By using ELISA and RT-PCR the brain level of TNF-<ce><b1>, IL-10, IL-4 and IL-12 determined. Significant decrease of clinical symptoms in trial group which received vitamin D was seen comparing to control animals (P<0.05). The level of TNF-<ce><b1> but not IL-10 significantly decreased following vitamin D3 administration. By comparing the level of Th1 and Th2 Interleukins and counting the ratio of them we found that in treated animals the ratio was significantly less than non-treated (P=0.01).

We examined the effect of TrkB signaling and the expression patterns of neurotrophic and gliotrophic factors in the mouse brain in MOG-induced experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). With induction of mild disease, TrkB heterozygous mice were more severely affected compared to their wild type littermates. However, with more potent disease induction, TrkB heterozygotes fared similar to their wild type littermates, suggesting complex modulatory roles for TrkB signaling. One possible explanation for this difference is that the expression patterns of neurotrophic factors correlate with disease severity in individual mice with mild disease, but not in more severe disease. With the less potent induction in C57BL/6 mice, we found that BDNF was consistently increased at EAE onset, while the soluble gliotrophic factor neuregulin (NRG1) was increased only in the chronic phase of the disease. Treatment of these animals with glatiramer acetate (GA) to decrease disease severity resulted in lower levels of both BDNF and NRG1 expression in some mice at 35days after immunization compared to those in untreated EAE mice, but had no direct effect on these factors in the absence of EAE. Our results suggest a complex interplay between neurotrophic and gliotrophic factors in EAE that is dependent on disease stage and severity. While signaling by BDNF through TrkB is protective in mild disease, this effect was not seen in more severe disease. The late induction of NRG1 in the chronic stage of disease could also worsen disease severity through its known ability to activate microglial, inflammatory pathways.

E.",2005,J Immunol,Vitamin D3 confers protection from autoimmune encephalomyelitis only in female mice,"The prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) increases significantly with decreasing UV B light exposure, possibly reflecting a protective effect of vitamin D(3). Consistent with this theory, previous research has shown a strong protective effect 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an MS model. However, it is not known whether the hormone precursor, vitamin D(3), has protective effects in EAE. To address this question, B10.PL mice were fed a diet with or without vitamin D(3), immunized with myelin basic protein, and studied for signs of EAE and for metabolites and transcripts of the vitamin D(3) endocrine system. The intact, vitamin D(3)-fed female mice had significantly less clinical, histopathological, and immunological signs of EAE than ovariectomized females or intact or castrated males. Correlating with reduced EAE, the intact, vitamin D(3)-fed female mice had significantly more 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and fewer CYP24A1 transcripts, encoding the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)-inactivating enzyme, in the spinal cord than the other groups of mice. Thus, there was an unexpected synergy between vitamin D(3) and ovarian tissue with regard to EAE inhibition. We hypothesize that an ovarian hormone inhibited CYP24A1 gene expression in the spinal cord, so the locally-produced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) accumulated and resolved the inflammation before severe EAE developed.

Because MS prevalence and severity decrease sharply with increasing sunlight exposure, and sunlight supports vitamin D(3) synthesis, we proposed that vitamin D(3) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)) may protect against MS. In support of this hypothesis, 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) strongly inhibited experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). This inhibition required lymphocytes other than the encephalitogenic T cells. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) might inhibit EAE through the action of IL-10-producing regulatory lymphocytes. We report that vitamin D(3) and 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) strongly inhibited myelin oligodendrocyte peptide (MOG(35-55))-induced EAE in C57BL/6 mice, but completely failed to inhibit EAE in mice with a disrupted IL-10 or IL-10R gene. Thus, a functional IL-10-IL-10R pathway was essential for 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) to inhibit EAE. The 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) also failed to inhibit EAE in reciprocal, mixed bone marrow chimeras constructed by transferring IL-10-deficient bone marrow into irradiated wild-type mice and vice versa. Thus, 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) may be enhancing an anti-inflammatory loop involving hemopoietic cell-produced IL-10 acting on brain parenchymal cells and vice versa. If this interpretation is correct, and humans have a similar bidirectional IL-10-dependent loop, then an IL-10-IL-10R pathway defect could abrogate the anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective functions of sunlight and vitamin D(3). In this way, a genetic IL-10-IL-10R pathway defect could interact with an environmental risk factor, vitamin D(3) insufficiency, to increase MS risk and severity.",10.4049/jimmunol.177.9.6030,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,both,7,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,"0,2",0.5,22,NA,2.8,22,NA,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Failed,NA

Epidemiological, genetic, and biological evidence suggests that insufficient vitamin D may be an MS risk factor. However, little is known about how vitamin D might be protective in MS. We hypothesized that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] might regulate gene expression patterns in a manner that would resolve inflammation. To test this hypothesis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in mice, 1,25-(OH)2D3 or a placebo was administered, and 6 h later, DNA microarray hybridization was performed with spinal cord RNA to analyze the gene expression patterns. At this time, clinical, histopathological, and biological studies showed that the two groups did not differ in EAE disease, but changes in several 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive genes indicated that the 1,25-(OH)2D3 had reached the CNS. Compared with normal mice, placebo-treated mice with EAE showed increased expression of many immune system genes, confirming the acute inflammation. When 1,25-(OH)2D3 was administered, several genes like glial fibrillary acidic protein and eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha kinase 4, whose expression increased or decreased with EAE, returned to homeostatic levels. Also, two genes with pro-apoptotic functions, calpain-2 and caspase-8-associated protein, increased significantly. A terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nicked end labeling study detected increased nuclear fragmentation in the 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated samples, confirming increased apoptosis.

E.",2015,J Neuroimmunol,Vitamin D and estrogen synergy in Vdr-expressing CD4(+) T cells is essential to induce Helios(+)FoxP3(+) T cells and prevent autoimmune demyelinating disease,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from an autoimmune attack on the axon-myelin unit. A female MS bias becomes evident after puberty and female incidence has tripled in the last half-century, implicating a female sex hormone interacting with a modifiable environmental factor. These aspects of MS suggest that many female MS cases may be preventable. Mechanistic knowledge of this hormone-environment interaction is needed to devise strategies to reduce female MS risk. We previously demonstrated that vitamin D3 (D3) deficiency increases and D3 supplementation decreases experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) risk in a female-biased manner. We also showed that D3 acts in an estrogen (E2)-dependent manner, since ovariectomy eliminated and E2 restored D3-mediated EAE protection. Here we probed the hypothesis that E2 and D3 interact synergistically within CD4(+) T cells to control T cell fate and prevent demyelinating disease. The E2 increased EAE resistance in wild-type (WT) but not T-Vdr(0) mice lacking Vdr gene function in CD4(+) T cells, so E2 action depended entirely on Vdr(+)CD4(+) T cells. The E2 levels were higher in WT than T-Vdr(0) mice, suggesting the Vdr(+)CD4(+) T cells produced E2 or stimulated its production. The E2 decreased Cyp24a1 and increased Vdr transcripts in T cells, prolonging the calcitriol half-life and increasing calcitriol responsiveness. The E2 also increased CD4(+)Helios(+)FoxP3(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells in a Vdr-dependent manner. Thus, CD4(+) T cells have a cooperative amplification loop involving E2 and calcitriol that promotes CD4(+)Helios(+)FoxP3(+) Treg cell development and is disrupted when the D3 pathway is impaired. The global decline in population D3 status may be undermining a similar cooperative E2-D3 interaction controlling Treg cell differentiation in women, causing a breakdown in T cell self tolerance and a rise in MS incidence.",10.1016/j.jneuroim.2015.06.015,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,both,7,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,0,1.4,11.5,0.3,3.2,11.5,0.1,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Estriol,1,0,1.2,11.5,0.2,2.7,13,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Failed,Failed

We hypothesized that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)) production by activated microglia and macrophages in the CNS inhibits these inflammatory processes. To test this hypothesis, we targeted the Cyp27b1 gene specifically in myeloid cells, then analyzed the influence of disrupted myeloid cell 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) synthesis on vitamin D(3)-mediated resistance to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Myeloid cell 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) synthesis was essential for vitamin D(3)-mediated EAE resistance. Increased CTLA-4 expression in the CNS-infiltrating CD4(+) Tconv and Treg cells and decreased splenic B cell CD86 expression correlated with resistance. These new data provide solid support for the view that vitamin D(3) reduces MS risk in part through a mechanism involving myeloid cell 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) production and CTLA-4 upregulation in CNS-infiltrating CD4(+) T cells.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) research firmly supports this hypothesis. Vitamin D3 supports 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-[OH]2D 3) synthesis in the CNS, initiating biological processes that reduce pathogenic CD4+ T cell longevity. MS is prevalent in Sardinia despite high ambient UV irradiation, challenging the vitamin D-MS hypothesis. Sardinian MS patients frequently carry a low Ifng expresser allele, suggesting that inadequate IFN-<ce><b3> may undermine vitamin D3-mediated inhibition of demyelinating disease. Testing this hypothesis, we found vitamin D3 failed to inhibit EAE in female Ifng knockout (GKO) mice, unlike wild-type mice. The two strains did not differ in Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1 gene expression, implying equivalent vitamin D3 metabolism in the CNS. The 1,25-(OH) 2D3 inhibited EAE in both strains, but 2-fold more 1,25-(OH)2D3 was needed in GKO mice, causing hypercalcemic toxicity. Unexpectedly, GKO mice had very low Vdr gene expression in the CNS. Injecting IFN-<ce><b3> intracranially into adult mice did not increase Vdr gene expression. Correlating with low Vdr expression, GKO mice had more numerous pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells in the CNS, and 1,25-(OH)2D3 reduced these cells in GKO and wild-type mice without altering Foxp3 + regulatory T cells. Thus, the Ifng gene was needed for CNS Vdr gene expression and vitamin D3-dependent mechanisms that inhibit EAE. Individuals with inadequate Ifng expression may have increased MS risk despite high ambient UV irradiation because of low Vdr gene expression and a high encephalitogenic T cell burden in the CNS.

Orally administered cholesterol-lowering HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (known as statins), which exhibit immunomodulatory properties and are effective in treatment of the MS model EAE, are being tested in MS. As atorvastatin can enhance protective Th2 responses and has a different mechanism of action than glatiramer acetate (GA), a parenterally administered immunomodulatory agent approved for MS treatment, we tested whether the combination of these agents could be beneficial in EAE. Combination therapy using suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and GA prevented or reversed clinical and histologic EAE. Secretion of proinflammatory Th1 cytokines was reduced--and conversely Th2 cytokine secretion was increased--in these mice, but not in mice treated with each drug alone at the same doses. Monocytes treated with the combination of suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and GA secreted an antiinflammatory type II cytokine pattern and, when used as APCs, promoted Th2 differentiation of naive myelin-specific T cells.

And anti-LINGO-1 improved learning ability and partly restored MBP level. Furthermore, we also found kinesin light chain (KLC), neurofilament light chain (NFL) and neurofilament heavy chain (NF200) were declined in demyelinated hippocampus, which could be partly improved by treatment with anti-LINGO-1. However, we did not observe the increased expression of beta amyloid, hyperphosphorylation of tau and loss of neurons in demyelinated hippocampus. Our results suggest that demyelination might lead to the impairment of neuronal transport, but not cause increased level of hyperphosphorylated tau and beta amyloid. Our research demonstrates remyelination might be an effective pathway to recover the function of neuronal axons and cognition in MS.",10.18632/oncotarget.8981,no,NA,PH,1,NA,cuprizone,mouse,C57BL/6,male,8,Opicinumab,control,3,51,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Failed,NA

In this study, we employed the murine cuprizone model of demyelination, in which remyelination occurs after removal of the toxin from the diet, to examine the cellular and molecular changes during demyelination and remyelination. Microglia accumulated in the corpus callosum during weeks 2-4 of the cuprizone diet, and these cells remained activated 2 weeks after the change to the normal diet. To examine the role of microglia in remyelination, mice were treated with minocycline to inactivate these cells after cuprizone-induced demyelination. Minocycline treatment reduced the number of CC1-positive oligodendrocytes, as well as levels of myelin basic protein (MBP) and CNPase in the remyelination phase. The expression of CNTF mRNA in the corpus callosum increased after 4 weeks on the cuprizone diet and remained high 2 weeks after the change to the normal diet. Minocycline suppressed CNTF expression during the remyelination phase on the normal diet. Primary culture experiments showed that CNTF was produced by microglia in addition to astrocytes.

The clinical and immunological effects of GA were extensively studied in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the experimental animal model for MS. The effect of oral administration of GA was tested in both rodents and primates in acute as well as in chronic relapsing (CR) models of EAE. Oral GA was found to suppress acute EAE induced in rats, mice, and rhesus monkeys. The effect of GA was also tested in several models of CR-EAE: proteolipid protein and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein induced CR-EAE in mice, CR-EAE in Biozzi mice, and CR-EAE in cynomolgus monkeys. In all the murine models, oral treatment with GA initiated at the peak of first relapse reduced the severity of disease and suppressed further relapses. Suppression of EAE with oral GA was associated with marked inhibition of spleen cell proliferation and Th1 cytokine (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) response to the respective autoantigens.

We now have demonstrated that oral Cop 1 inhibited EAE induction in both rats and mice. Furthermore, oral Cop 1 was more effective than oral MBP in suppressing EAE in rats. The beneficial effect of oral Cop 1 was found to be associated with specific inhibition of the proliferative and Th1 cytokine secretion responses to MBP of spleen cells from Cop 1-fed mice and rats. In all of these assays, oral Cop 1 was more effective than oral MBP. The tolerance induced by Cop 1 could be adoptively transferred with spleen cells from Cop 1-fed animals. Furthermore, Cop 1-specific T cell lines, which inhibit EAE induction in vivo, could be isolated from the above spleen cells. These T cell lines secrete the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor type beta, but not IL-4, in response to both Cop 1 and MBP. In conclusion, oral Cop 1 has a beneficial effect on the development of EAE that is associated with down-regulation of T cell immune responses to MBP and is mediated by Th2/3 type regulatory cells.

MS patients treated with GA developed GA reactive antibodies, which peaked at three months and decreased at six months. In order to find out whether anti-GA antibodies may neutralize the therapeutic effect of GA, we tested both polyclonal (mouse and human) and monoclonal GA specific antibodies for their ability to interfere with the biological activity of GA in several assay systems. None of the antibodies interfered with GA activities either in vitro (binding to MHC molecules and T cell stimulation) or in vivo (blocking of EAE). Furthermore, 53 samples of sera obtained from 34 MS patients that participated in the open label trial in Israel, and all developed GA specific antibodies, were tested for their ability to inhibit the proliferation response of GA specific Ts cell clone and to interfere with GA competitive inhibition of the response to peptide 84-102 of myelin basic protein (MBP). None of the sera inhibited and some even enhanced the in vitro activities of GA.

Clinically, ER<ce><b1> ligand treatment abrogated disease at the onset and throughout the disease course. In contrast, ER<ce><b2> ligand treatment had no effect at disease onset but promoted recovery during the chronic phase of the disease. ER<ce><b1> ligand treatment was antiinflammatory in the systemic immune system, whereas ER<ce><b2> ligand treatment was not. Also, ER<ce><b1> ligand treatment reduced CNS inflammation, whereas ER<ce><b2> ligand treatment did not. Interestingly, treatment with either the ER<ce><b1> or the ER<ce><b2> ligand was neuroprotective, as evidenced by reduced demyelination and preservation of axon numbers in white matter, as well as decreased neuronal abnormalities in gray matter. Thus, by using the ER<ce><b2> selective ligand, we have dissociated the antiinflammatory effect from the neuroprotective effect of estrogen treatment and have shown that neuroprotective effects of estrogen treatment do not necessarily depend on antiinflammatory properties.

Thus, the development of therapies that are neuroprotective has elicited considerable interests. Estrogens and estrogen receptor (ER) ligand treatments are promising treatments to prevent MS-induced neurodegeneration and a multicenter phase II clinical trial of estriol as a beneficial therapy in MS is underway. Here, we discuss studies performed in our laboratory that examined the effects of ER ligands in the inflammatory/demyelinating disorder experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Administration of estriol or 17beta-estradiol reduced clinical severity and this clinical disease improvement was associated with favorable changes in cytokine production. There was a significant decrease of neuronal pathology in gray matter along with myelin and axon preservation in white matter of spinal cords of mice with EAE. In subsequent experiments, we contrasted the results of ERalpha versus ERbeta ligand treatment. While ERalpha ligand treatment was anti-inflammatory, ERbeta ligand treatment was not. ERbeta ligand treatment nevertheless reduced demyelination and preserved axon numbers in white matter and prevented neuronal abnormalities in gray matter. Clinically, ERalpha ligand treatment abrogated the disease at the onset, while ERbeta ligand treatment had no effect at disease onset, but promoted recovery. Thus, unlike ERalpha ligand treatment, ERbeta ligand treatment was protective at the level of the target organ, independent of anti-inflammatory effects in the peripheral immune system.

Effective GA treatment is associated with the induction of anti-inflammatory T(H)2 responses and antigen-specific expansion of CD25(+)/Foxp3(+) Tregs through the modulation of antigen-presenting cells. Here, we show that intravenous injection of fluorochrome-labelled GA resulted in rapid and specific binding of GA to CD11b(+) F4/80(lo) Ly6G(-) blood monocytes via an MHC class II-independent mechanism. Intravenous GA treatment enhanced the intrinsic capability of these monocytes to directly suppress T cell proliferation in vitro. The suppressive function correlated with reduced proliferation of myelin-specific T cells in vivo after intravenous GA treatment. In contrast, subcutaneous treatment with GA inhibited the pro-inflammatory IFN<ce><b3>-producing T cell phenotype rather than suppressing T cell proliferation. These data indicate that (1) GA engages directly with circulating monocytes to induce type II monocyte suppressor function; and (2) the therapeutic efficacy of GA may be expanded by employing different routes of GA administration to engage alternative mechanisms of suppression of autoreactive T cells in MS.",10.1111/j.1365-3083.2011.02575.x,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,both,10,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,NA,1,0,5,0,4.5,5,0.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

Here, we tested whether DMF also modulates B cells, which are newly recognized key players in MS, and to which extent DMF restricts ongoing loss of oligodendrocytes and axons in the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, blood samples and brain tissue from DMF-treated MS patients were analyzed by flow cytometry or histopathological examination, respectively. Complementary mechanistic studies were conducted in inflammatory as well as non-inflammatory CNS demyelinating mouse models. In this study, DMF reduced the frequency of antigen-experienced and memory B cells and rendered remaining B cells less prone to activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Dissecting the functional consequences of these alterations, we found that DMF ameliorated a B cell-accentuated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model by diminishing the capacity of B cells to act as antigen-presenting cells for T cells. In a non-inflammatory model of toxic demyelination, DMF limited oligodendrocyte apoptosis, promoted maturation of oligodendrocyte precursors and reduced axonal damage. In a CNS biopsy of a DMF-treated MS patient, we equivalently observed higher numbers of mature oligodendrocytes as well as a reduced extent of axonal damage when compared to a cohort of treatment-na<c3><af>ve patients. In conclusion, we showed that besides suppressing T cells, DMF dampens pathogenic B cell functions, which probably contributes to its clinical effectiveness in relapsing MS.

Human S1PR1 variants have been reported to have functional heterogeneity in vitro, suggesting that S1PR1 function may influence FTY720 efficacy. In this study, we examined the influence of S1PR1 phosphorylation on response to FTY720 in neuroinflammation. We found that mice carrying a phosphorylation-defective S1pr1 gene [S1PR1(S5A) mice] were refractory to FTY720 treatment in MOG(35-55)-immunized and Th17-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models. Long-term treatment with FTY720 induced significant lymphopenia and suppressed Th17 response in the peripheral immune system via downregulating STAT3 phosphorylation in both WT and S1PR1(S5A) mice. However, FTY720 did not effectively prevent neuroinflammation in the S1PR1(S5A) EAE mice as a result of encephalitogenic cells expressing C-C chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6).

However, the primary mechanism by which IFN-beta mediates its therapeutic effect remains unclear. Recent studies indicate that under defined conditions, IFN-beta may downregulate DC expression of IL-12. We and others have shown that IFN-beta may also downregulate IL-10. In light of the recently proposed paradigm that an IL-10/IL-12 immunoregulatory circuit controls susceptibility to autoimmune disease, we examined the effect of IFN-beta on the development and behavior of the autoreactive T cell repertoire during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model sharing many features with MS. SWXJ mice were immunized with the immunodominant p139-151 determinant of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), and at onset of EAE were treated every other day with IFN-beta. After eight weeks of treatment, we assessed autoreactivity and observed no significant IFN-beta effect on splenocyte proliferation or splenocyte production of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, or IL-5 in response to the priming determinant used to initiate disease. However, in IFN-beta treated mice, the cytokine profile in response to the priming immunogen was significantly skewed toward an increased production of IL-10 and a concurrent decreased production of IL-12. Moreover, the in vivo modulation of the IL-10/IL-12 immunoregulatory circuit in response to the priming immunogen was accompanied by an aborted development of epitope spreading. Our results indicate that IFN-beta induces a reciprocal modulation of the IL-10/IL-12 cytokine circuit in vivo. This skewed autoreactivity establishes an inflammatory microenvironment that effectively prevents endogenous self-priming thereby inhibiting the progression of disease associated with epitope spreading.",10.1016/s0165-5728(00)00384-2,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SWXJ,female,NA,Interferon Beta 1,control,1,NA,1,1.9,9,0.2,3,9,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

Further, adoptive transfer of GA-induced CD8(+) T cells resulted in amelioration of EAE, establishing a role as a viable immunotherapy in demyelinating disease. Generation of these cells required indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), while suppressive function depended on non-classical MHC class I, IFN-<ce><b3>, and perforin expression.

The use of 4-AP in MS is based upon its ability to facilitate conduction in axons blocked by demyelination. This improvement is due to blocking of potassium (K+) channels in these fibres. Because K+ channels also play an important role in immune mechanisms successful treatment with K+ channel blockers in neuroimmunological diseases may have several causes. Therefore it seems important to study effects of K+ channel blockers in animal models of autoimmune disease. MATERIAL & METHODS: We studied the effects of 4-AP and quinidine on actively induced acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Lewis rats. RESULTS: There was no effect on the incidence of the disease. The severity of the disease was also unchanged although the disease duration was slightly diminished in the treated groups. Immunohistological comparison between the animals of different groups showed no differences.

Glatiramer acetate is a mixture of randomly synthesized peptides that induces both T cell activation and antibody production in all treated individuals. These observations prompted us to compare the independent effects of adoptively transferred GA-reactive T cells and antibodies in mice with chronic inflammatory demyelination induced by Theiler's virus. Transferred T cells had no effect on lesion load or the extent of remyelination. Purified polyclonal GA antibodies also did not alter lesion load, which suggests that neither GA T cells or antibodies were pathogenic. On the contrary, GA antibodies enhanced the normally low level of remyelination in chronic lesions. The antibodies, which were primarily immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 and IgG2, cross-reacted with oligodendrocytes, perivascular infiltrating cells, astrocytes, and neurons in spinal cord sections. In glial cultures they bound subsets of early lineage oligodendrocytes and microglia. Thus, several mechanisms may have contributed to the promotion of remyelination. These results support the hypothesis that the antibody response in GA-treated patients is beneficial by facilitating repair of demyelinated lesions.",10.1096/fj.01-1023fje,no,NA,PH,1,NA,TMEV-IDD,mouse,SJL,female,7,Glatiramer acetate,control,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

Rapid reversal of the antiproliferative activity of IFN-beta and excessive expansion of autoreactive T cells as disease promoting mechanisms,"IFN-beta has recently been shown to exert remarkable beneficial effects on disease development in patients with early stage relapsing-remitting MS. The specific immune mechanism(s) by which IFN-beta ameliorates this human demyelinating disease is at present undefined. One potential mechanism may reside in the antiproliferative activity of IFN-beta which may inhibit the expansion of autoaggressive T cells thereby limiting disease progression. In the present study we investigated whether the administration of recombinant rat IFN-beta (rrIFN-beta) to Lewis rats with actively induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) inhibits the expansion of encephalitogenic T cells in lymphoid organs and as such may contribute to suppression of disease activity in this widely used animal model for MS. Our data show that daily administrations of > or = 3 x 10(5) u rrIFN-beta to EAE rats, starting two days before MBP sensitization and continued for 10 days led to a dramatic and dose-dependent reduction in encephalitogenic T cells in both spleen and inguinal lymph nodes at day 8 post-immunization (p.i.). However, the rrIFN-beta-mediated reduction in effector T cells did not ameliorate paralytic disease as expected but significantly enhanced the severity of EAE. Analyses of lymphoid organs in the remission phase of EAE revealed strongly elevated numbers of encephalitogenic T cells in rrIFN-beta-treated versus control rats suggesting a rapid reversal of the antiproliferative action of rrIFN-beta followed by an overshoot in the subsequent expansion of these effector T cells.

A major goal in the development of immunomodulatory strategies is the discovery of combinations of drugs exerting synergistic immunomodulatory effects. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3, is an immunomodulator that interacts with T cells but mainly targets antigen-presenting cells. We have demonstrated synergism between 1,25(OH)2D3 and cyclosporine, rapamycin, and FK506. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this synergism could be observed with other immunosuppressants (mycophenolate mofetil, leflunomide, and the methylxanthine A802715) and whether analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 share this synergistic capacity in vivo. METHODS: In vitro, the median effect analysis was applied to the inhibition of phytohemagglutinin A-induced lymphocyte proliferation. In vivo, synergism between analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 and cyclosporine or mycophenolate mofetil was evaluated in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. RESULTS: In vitro, all combinations with 1,25(OH)2D3 were synergistic. The strongest synergism was seen with the inhibitors of interleukin 2 secretion, cyclosporine and FK506 (indexes 0.16 and 0.27, respectively). The weakest synergism was observed in combinations using A802715, a second-signal inhibitor (index 0.52), or the nucleotide synthesis inhibitor mycophenolate mofetil (index 0.43). In vivo, analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 share the in vitro-observed synergism with 1,25(OH)2D3. Moreover, the differences in synergism with different immunomodulators were also present in vivo, where the best synergism was again seen in combination with cyclosporine (up to 100% paralysis protection). CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogs are potent dose-reducing drugs for other immunomodulators, making them potentially interesting for clinical use in autoimmunity and transplantation.",10.1097/00007890-200005150-00032,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SJL,female,9,Vitamin D3,control,1,439,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Failed,NA

The strong immunomodulatory potency of TX527 is reflected by its ability to attenuate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of multiple sclerosis (MS). At present most MS patients are being treated with systemic IFN-beta administration. The aim of this study was to investigate whether combining IFN-beta with TX527 could empower its EAE-protective effects. We evaluated also combinations with the standard immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA). EAE was induced in SJL mice by PLP immunization, treatment was started 3 days before disease induction. The TX527+IFN-beta combination resulted in significant disease protection which was superior to the effect of both treatment separately. No disease amelioration, even aggravation, was obtained with the IFN-beta+CsA combination. By adding TX527 to the IFN-beta+CsA combination near complete protection from EAE was achieved (100% protection from paralysis, mean maximal score of 1.8+/-1.5, both p<0.05 versus controls and all individual treatments). From these data we conclude that adding TX527 to an IFN-beta and/or CsA treatment results in clear additional immunomodulatory effects in EAE prevention and is therefore a potentially interesting candidate to be considered in clinical intervention trials in MS.",10.1016/j.jsbmb.2006.12.094,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,SJL,female,9,Interferon Beta 1,control,1,76,0,2.4,18,NA,1.2,17,NA,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

Attempts to block this pathway have been effective in preventing unwanted immune reactions. As B7 blockade might also affect Treg cells and interfere with negative signaling through membrane CTLA-4 on effector T (Teff) cells, its immune-modulatory effects are potentially more complex. Here, we used the mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS), EAE, to study the effect of B7 blockade. An effective therapy for MS patients has to interfere with ongoing inflammation, and therefore we injected CTLA-4Ig at day 7 and 9 after immunization, when myelin-reactive T cells have been primed and start migrating toward the CNS. Surprisingly, B7 blockade exacerbated disease signs and resulted in more severe CNS inflammation and demyelination, and was associated with an enhanced production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IFN-<ce><b3>. Importantly, CTLA-4Ig treatment resulted in a transient reduction of Ki67 and CTLA-4 expression and function of peripheral Treg cells.

We employed a murine model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in order to determine the role of NKT cells in 1,25D3-mediated protection from EAE. Wild-type (WT) mice or mice lacking all NKT cells (CD1d(-/-)) or invariant NKT cells (J<ce><b1>18(-/-)) were fed control or 1,25D3-supplemented diets.

We and others have previously shown that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and alters CD4(+) T cell subpopulations. In this study, we investigated how EGCG impacts differentiation of na<c3><af>ve CD4(+) T cells into different effector lineages and report that EGCG impeded Th1, Th9, and Th17 differentiation and prevented IL-6-induced suppression of Treg development. We further showed that EGCG inhibited T-bet, PU.1, and ROR<ce><b3>t, the specific transcription factors for Th1, Th9, and Th17 differentiation, respectively. These effects, in turn, may be mediated by EGCG-induced downregulation of transducers p-STAT1 and p-STAT4 for Th1, and p-STAT3 for Th17. EGCG-induced change in Th17/Treg balance may be mediated by its inhibition of IL-6 signaling because EGCG inhibited soluble IL-6R, membrane gp130, and IL-6-induced phosphorylation of STAT3. This notion was further supported by the in vivo results showing inhibited IL-6 and soluble IL-6R but increased soluble gp130 levels in plasma from EAE mice fed EGCG.

Prophylactic administration of FTY720 suppressed the disease onset and prevented axon and myelin damage when compared with EAE mice without treatment. Therapeutic treatment by FTY720 did not prevent EAE onset, but reduced disease severity, improving axial and radial diffusivity towards the control values without statistical significance.

Besides inhibiting development of encephalitogenic T cells, atorvastatin treatment of EAE has been associated with an induction of anti-inflammatory myelin-reactive T-helper type (Th)-2 cells. To investigate the clinical significance of atorvastatin-mediated Th2 differentiation, we first evaluated atorvastatin treatment in interleukin (IL)-4 green fluorescent protein-enhanced transcript (4-GET) reporter mice. Atorvastatin treatment failed to induce IL-4-producing Th2 cells in vivo; however, when T cells from atorvastatin-treated 4-GET mice were reactivated in vitro, T cells preferentially differentiated into Th2 cells, while antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (interferon gamma, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor and IL-12) were reduced. Oral atorvastatin also prevented or reversed EAE in signal transducer and activator of transcription 6-deficient (STAT6-/-) mice, which cannot generate IL-4-producing Th2 cells. Further, atorvastatin treatment did not induce or expand Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in either wild-type or STAT6-/- mice. In vivo proliferation of T cells, as measured by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine, was inhibited in atorvastatin-treated wild-type and STAT6-/- mice.

Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) manifests with serious physical disability. To quantitatively analyze differential protein expression in patients with SPMS, we performed two-dimensional fluorescence difference in-gel electrophoresis, followed by mass spectrometry on the cerebrospinal fluid of these patients and patients with other neurological diseases. Vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), gelsolin, albumin, etc. showed more than a 1.5-fold difference between the two groups. Based on these results, an experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis in Lewis rats was used to investigate DBP's role in the disease. Protein levels, mRNA transcripts, and ligands of DBP in different regions of the CNS were evaluated under various vitamin D intake levels. Here, DBP levels increased in the experimental rat groups compared to the control groups regardless of vitamin D intake. Moreover, DBP mRNA levels varied in different parts of the CNS including spinal cords in the experimental groups. The observed differences between DBP protein and mRNA levels in the experimental groups' spinal cords could be derived from the disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, an interaction between DBP and actin was confirmed using coimmunoprecipitation and western blot. These results indicate a role for DBP in the actin scavenge system. Moreover, in the experimental group that received oral vitamin D3 supplement, we observed both delayed onset and diminished severity of the disease. When DBP was upregulated, however, the benefits from the vitamin D3 supplements were lost. Thus, we inferred that high levels of DBP were adverse to recovery. In conclusion, here we observed upregulated DBP in the cerebrospinal fluid could serve as a specific diagnostic biomarker for the progression of multiple sclerosis. Next, we demonstrate the vital function of increased levels of free vitamin D metabolites for multiple sclerosis treatment.

METHODS: EAE was induced in 7-week-old C57BL/6 female mice. Visual acuity (VA) was assessed daily to detect onset of ON after which daily oral-treatment with either fingolimod (1<c2><a0>mg/kg) or saline was given for ten weeks. In vivo DBSI scans of optic nerves were performed at baseline, 2-, 6- and 10-weeks post treatment.

The present study aimed to determine whether fingolimod therapy is beneficial to the visual system in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice.

Moreover, apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and oligodendrocytes in the optic nerve was significantly reduced with fingolimod treatment compared to that in the untreated EAE mice. These results suggested that fingolimod exerts neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects on the retina and optic nerve in a mouse model of EAE.

Antigen-specific T cell activity and T cell subpopulations were analyzed by using flow cytometric analysis. Spinal cords were excised and examined immunohistochemically. Results After treatment with FTY720 alone, CD4+ T cells from inguinal lymph nodes (LN) maintained activity towards pathogenic autoantigen. The percentage of CD4+CD44highCD62Llow (effector memory) T cells in inguinal LN was significantly increased. At day 8 after discontinuation, infiltration of CD3+ and CD4+ cells in spinal cords was significantly increased, and the absolute number of CD4+ T cells in inguinal LN was decreased. However, in the case of combination treatment, the absolute number of CD4+ T cells in inguinal LN remained unchanged, and infiltration of CD3+ and CD4+ cells was significantly suppressed. Conclusions As the number of CD4+ T cells in inguinal LN was unchanged in the FTY720 plus MOG35-55 group, the combination treatment might inhibit relapse by decreasing the ability of pathogenic T cells to migrate from peripheral tissues to the central nervous system.

Treatment with IFNbeta results in a significant decrease in the rate of clinical relapse and a marked delay in progression to disability compared to placebo-treated control patients. In the present study, we demonstrate similar therapeutic effects after treating (SWR X SJL)F1 mice with IFNbeta at the onset of clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a disease animal model widely used in MS studies. EAE was actively induced by immunization of (SWR X SJL)F1 mice with the immunodominant encephalitogenic peptide 139-151 of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP). In blinded testing, mice treated with IFNbeta at EAE onset showed a delay in progression to clinical disability as determined by marked improvement with time in mean clinical score, significant delay in onset of relapse, and significant decrease in exacerbation frequency compared to placebo-treated control mice. The therapeutic effect of IFNbeta was accompanied by a significant inhibition of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) but not proliferation in response to the priming PLP 139-151. In addition, IFNbeta treatment resulted in an overall decrease in severity of both inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system. These results mimic in an autoimmune animal model the effectiveness of IFNbeta treatment observed in MS. Moreover, our study suggests that anti-viral properties of IFNbeta are not essential for producing therapeutic effects in autoimmune demyelinating disease, and that the efficacy of IFNbeta in the treatment of MS may be due to inhibition of autoreactivity.",10.1016/0165-5728(95)00160-3,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,(SWRxSJL)F1,female,NA,Interferon Beta 1,control,1,NA,1,2.3,13,0.3,3.7,18,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

We have previously reported that in juvenile/adolescent rats, vitamin D supplementation protects from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Here we demonstrate that this protective effect associates with decreased proliferation of CD4+ T cells and lower frequency of pathogenic T helper (Th) 17 cells. Using transcriptome, methylome, and pathway analyses in CD4+ T cells, we show that vitamin D affects multiple signaling and metabolic pathways critical for T-cell activation and differentiation into Th1 and Th17 subsets in vivo. Namely, Jak/Stat, Erk/Mapk, and Pi3K/Akt/mTor signaling pathway genes were down-regulated upon vitamin D supplementation. The protective effect associated with epigenetic mechanisms, such as (i) changed levels of enzymes involved in establishment and maintenance of epigenetic marks, i.e., DNA methylation and histone modifications; (ii) genome-wide reduction of DNA methylation, and (iii) up-regulation of noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs, with concomitant down-regulation of their protein-coding target RNAs involved in T-cell activation and differentiation. We further demonstrate that treatment of myelin-specific T cells with vitamin D reduces frequency of Th1 and Th17 cells, down-regulates genes in key signaling pathways and epigenetic machinery, and impairs their ability to transfer EAE. Finally, orthologs of nearly 50% of candidate MS risk genes and 40% of signature genes of myelin-reactive T cells in MS changed their expression in vivo in EAE upon supplementation, supporting the hypothesis that vitamin D may modulate risk for developing MS.",10.1073/pnas.1615783114,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,rat,Dark Agouti,female,NA,Vitamin D3,control,1,NA,NA,0.5,15,0.2,2,14,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,rat,Failed,NA

Microglia play an important role in neuroinflammation. The M1 phenotype of microglia is involved in the proinflammatory process of the disease, while the M2 phenotype plays an anti-inflammatory role. Promoting the polarization of microglia to M2 in MS/EAE is a promising therapeutic strategy. This study is aimed at exploring the effects of BSYS on microglial polarization in mice with EAE. METHODS: The EAE model was established by the intraperitoneal injection of pertussis toxin and subcutaneous injection of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)(35-55) in C57BL/6J mice. The mice were treated with BSYS (3.02<e2><80><89>g/kg), FTY720 (0.3<e2><80><89>mg/kg), or distilled water by intragastric administration. H&E and LFB staining, transmission electron microscopy, qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, ELISA, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and western blotting were used to detect the histological changes in myelin, microglial M1/M2 polarization markers, and the expression of key genes involved in EAE. Results and Conclusions. BSYS treatment of EAE mice increased the body weight, decreased the clinical score, and reduced demyelination induced by inflammatory infiltration. BSYS also inhibited the mRNA expression of M1 microglial markers while increasing the mRNA level of M2 markers. Additionally, BSYS led to a marked decrease in the ratio of M1 microglia (iNOS(+)/Iba1(+)) and an obvious increase in the number of M2 microglia (Arg1(+)/Iba1(+)). In the EAE mouse model, miR-124 expression was decreased, and miR-155 expression was increased, while BSYS treatment significantly reversed this effect and modulated the levels of C/EBP <ce><b1>, PU.1, and SOCS1 (target genes of miR-124 and miR-155). Therefore, the neuroprotective effect of BSYS against MS/EAE was related to promoting microglia toward M2 polarization, which may be correlated with changes in miR-124 and miR-155 in vivo.",10.1155/2021/5521503,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,7,Fingolimod,control,1,40,1,3,10,1,6.3,10,0.8,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

During pregnancy, it appears in maternal serum within 6-24 h of fertilization, is present for at least the first two-thirds of pregnancy in all species studied and is essential for embryonic survival. It is a homologue of chaperonin 10, a heat shock protein, but, unlike other members of this family, EPF has an extracellular role. As it has the ability to modulate CD4+ T cell-dependent immune responses, its role in treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was investigated. EAE is a CD4+ T cell-mediated disease, the best available animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Two models of EAE were investigated, acute EAE induced in Lewis rats by inoculation with myelin basic protein (MBP-EAE) and chronic relapsing EAE induced in SJL/J mice by inoculation with myelin proteolipid protein peptide (residues 139-151) (PLP-EAE). EPF, delivered intraperitoneally or orally to rats or intraperitoneally to mice, suppressed clinical signs of disease. Mice with PLP-EAE were also treated with interferon-beta, with and without EPF.

The remyelination process is mediated by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that Fingolimod, a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, stimulates OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes, in addition to its well-known anti-inflammatory effect. Using an animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we performed a dose-response study of Fingolimod (0.15 or 0.3mg/kg bw), which was initiated on the day of EAE onset. The neurological function was tested to determine the optimal dose of Fingolimod. Immunofluorescent staining was performed to measure the profile of OPC proliferation and differentiation. The mechanistic premise underlying the therapeutic effect of Fingolimod, was that Fingolimod stimulates the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway, and this pathway promotes OPC differentiation. To test this hypothesis, a loss-of-function study using cyclopamine, an inhibitor of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway, was employed in vivo. Protein levels of the Shh pathway were measured by Western blot analysis. We found that Fingolimod treatment (0.3mg/kg bw) significantly decreased cumulative disease score compared to the EAE control group. Concurrently, OPCs and proliferation of OPCs were significantly increased in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord at day 7 and day 30 after EAE onset, and oligodendrocytes, myelination and differentiation of OPCs were significantly increased at day 30 compared with the EAE control group. EAE mice treated with Fingolimod exhibited substantially elevated levels of Shh, its receptor Smoothened and effector Gli1 in the white matter of the CNS. However, combination treatment of EAE mice with cyclopamine-Fingolimod decreased Fingolimod monotherapy elevated protein levels of Smoothened and Gli1, and abolished the effect of Fingolimod on OPC proliferation and differentiation, as well as on neurological function outcome. Together, these data demonstrate that Fingolimod is effective as a treatment of EAE by promoting OPC proliferation and differentiation, which facilitate remyelination.

Our study demonstrates that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is upregulated in the serum and spinal cords of EAE rats, but that vitamin D reverses the upregulation to alleviate inflammation. Vitamin D, however, cannot prevent the disease process, suggesting that other factors may be involved. To identify additional factors that might limit vitamin D efficacy, we assessed the effects of vitamin D on plasma gelsolin (pGSN), a regulator of S1P that is downregulated in the CSF of MS patients. Our results show that pGSN is downregulated in the serum of EAE rats, whereas its cellular form, cytoplasmic gelsolin (cGSN), is upregulated in the spinal cord of EAE rats. Importantly, vitamin D causes a downregulation of both pGSN and cGSN, which may counteract the positive effects of S1P decrease. Furthermore, 48 and 42<e2><80><89>kDa caspase-3 cleavage products of cGSN are detected in EAE spinal cords, suggesting enhanced apoptotic activity, but these cleaved products undergo a similar decrease upon vitamin D treatment.

Data from in vivo MRI and post-mortem studies in MS indicate that the hippocampus is targeted. However, the relationship between structural pathology and dysfunction of the hippocampus in MS remains unclear. Hippocampal neuropathology also occurs in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the most commonly used animal model of MS. Although estrogen treatment of EAE has been shown to be anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective in the spinal cord, it is unknown if estrogen treatment may prevent hippocampal pathology and dysfunction. In the current study we examined excitatory synaptic transmission during EAE and focused on pathological changes in synaptic protein complexes known to orchestrate functional synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. We then determined if estriol, a candidate hormone treatment, was capable of preventing functional changes in synaptic transmission and corresponding hippocampal synaptic pathology. Electrophysiological studies revealed altered excitatory synaptic transmission and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) during EAE. Neuropathological experiments demonstrated that there were decreased levels of pre- and post-synaptic proteins in the hippocampus, diffuse loss of myelin staining and atrophy of the pyramidal layers of hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1). Estriol treatment prevented decreases in excitatory synaptic transmission and lessened the effect of EAE on PPF. In addition, estriol treatment prevented several neuropathological alterations that occurred in the hippocampus during EAE. Cross-modality correlations revealed that deficits in excitatory synaptic transmission were significantly correlated with reductions in trans-synaptic protein binding partners known to modulate excitatory synaptic transmission. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a functional correlate to hippocampal neuropathology in any MS model.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) has been widely employed to evaluate new strategies to control MS, including procedures to induce immunological tolerance. Considering that skin exposure to protein antigens can induce tolerance and that vitamin D analogs conserve immunomodulatory potential and are less toxic, we investigated the efficacy of epicutaneous application of a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG(35-55)) associated with paricalcitol (PARI) on EAE development. Three and 11<e2><80><89>days after EAE induction, C57BL/6 mice were treated with an occlusive patch containing MOG plus PARI. Clinical parameters were daily assessed, whereas immunological and histological evaluations were performed during the acute EAE phase. MOG and MOG<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>PARI significantly controlled disease development reducing weight loss and clinical score. Moreover, MOG and MOG<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>PARI reduced the inflammatory process and preserved the myelin sheath in the CNS. High percentages of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) and lower MHCII fluorescence intensity in dendritic cells in draining lymph nodes were concomitantly observed. MOG<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>PARI association was, however, more efficient being able to reduce disease incidence and clinical scores more significantly than MOG or PARI alone. This experimental group also displayed a higher ratio between mRNA expression for Foxp3 and RORc and a higher percentage of Foxp3(+) cells in the CNS. Modulation of activation markers observed in microglial cells eluted from EAE treated mice were confirmed by in vitro studies with the BV-2 microglial cell line. The results show that MOG<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>PARI association applied by an epicutaneous route controlled EAE development. Protective involved mechanisms include mainly a higher proportion of Tregs and also a direct immunomodulatory effect of PARI on microglial cells.",10.3389/fimmu.2017.01198,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,6,Vitamin D3,control,1,41,1,0,6,0,2.2,5,0.4,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Failed,NA

M.",2019,Mol Vis,Dimethyl fumarate mitigates optic neuritis,"PURPOSE: Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), a demyelinating autoimmune disease characterized by acute episodes of motor, sensory, and cognitive symptoms. Optic neuritis is an episodic sequela experienced by some patients with RRMS that typically presents as acute, monocular vision loss. Episodes of optic neuritis damage and kill retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and can culminate in permanent vision loss. The purpose of these studies was to evaluate the capacity of DMF to mitigate optic neuritis. The work presented combines studies of a mouse model of MS and a retrospective chart analysis of files of patients with RRMS treated at the MS Center of Excellence within the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. METHODS: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a well-established mouse model that recapitulates cardinal features of somatic and visual MS pathologies. EAE was induced in female C57BL/6J mice by inoculation with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (residues 35-55; MOG(35-55)). DMF or vehicle was administered twice a day by oral gavage. Visual acuity was measured longitudinally with optokinetic tracking. Post-mortem analyses included quantification of RGCs in retinal flatmounts and quantitative PCR (qPCR) of Nrf2 target genes and regulators of myelin. Retrospective chart analyses were performed using data obtained from deidentified files of patients with RRMS. RESULTS: In the EAE mouse studies, DMF decreased optic neuritis severity, preserved vision and RGCs, and concomitantly reduced motor deficits when administered by two different treatment regimens (prevention or interventional). DMF was more efficacious when administered as an interventional therapy, and the beneficial effects occurred independently of the induction of Nrf2 target genes. A complementary retrospective chart analysis demonstrated that DMF increased the time to a recurrence of optic neuritis, and protected against subsequent bouts of optic neuritis. CONCLUSIONS: This work underscores the potential of DMF to mitigate the severity and recurrence of optic neuritis episodes in patients with RRMS.",NA,no,NA,PH,1,NA,EAE,mouse,C57BL/6,female,14,Dimethyl fumarate,control,1,NA,"1,2",0.8,8,0.2,2.5,8,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mouse,Marketed,NA

Utilising fingolimod as a clinically validated therapy we evaluated the use of repeated brain tissue volume measures during chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as a new preclinical efficacy measure. Brain volume changes were quantified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7<e2><80><af>Tesla and correlated to treatment-induced brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) measured in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, spinal cord and brain. Serial brain MRI measurements revealed slow progressive brain volume loss in vehicle treated EAE mice despite a stable clinical score. Fingolimod (1<e2><80><af>mg/kg) significantly ameliorated brain tissue atrophy in the cerebellum and striatum when administered from established EAE disease onwards. Fingolimod-dependent tissue preservation was associated with induction of BDNF specifically within the brain and co-localized with neuronal soma. In contrast, therapeutic teriflunomide (3<e2><80><af>mg/kg) treatment failed to inhibit CNS autoimmune mediated brain degeneration. Finally, weekly anti-IL-17A antibody (15<e2><80><af>mg/kg) treatment was highly efficacious and preserved whole brain, cerebellum and striatum volume.
