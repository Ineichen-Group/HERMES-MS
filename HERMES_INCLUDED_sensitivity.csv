MATERIAL AND METHODS: FTY720 was used for treatment of rats in a model of chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) at an oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on in vivo tracking of macrophages labeled with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles, immunohistological staining (IHC), and neurological readouts was used to study the burden of disease in treated and untreated animals. RESULTS: While untreated animals showed severe paralysis of the hind paws, intense accumulation of macrophages in brain tissue, and areas of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, FTY720-treated animals displayed no signs of inflammatory activity or neurological impairment. These observations were made for both acute phase and first relapse. CONCLUSION: Tracking of macrophages by MRI provides direct evidence of the immunomodulatory efficacy of FTY720 in the EAE model and correlates well with neurological symptoms and histology.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","rat","Lewis","female",NA,"Fingolimod","control",1,37,"0,2",0.2,5,NA,1.8,5,NA,NA,0,5,NA,11,5,NA,NA,"T2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.09,5,0.1,0.3,15,0.11,NA,"gadolinium",NA,0.04,5,0.09,0.2,15,0.03,NA,"gadolinium",-0.07,5,0.04,0.14,15,0.03,NA,"gadolinium","rat","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","9","not reported","0","rat","15","mouse","2","female","histology","behaviour","imaging","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","10.1002/jmri.20057","martin.rausch@pharma.novartis.com","1","1","164","324","427","164 - 427","1 - 766"

We postulated that MMF exerts neuroprotective effects through modulation of microglia activation, a critical component of the neuroinflammatory cascade that occurs in neurodegenerative diseases such as MS. To ascertain our hypothesis and define the mechanistic pathways involved in the modulating effect of fumarates, we used real-time PCR and biochemical assays to assess changes in the molecular and functional phenotype of microglia, quantitative Western blotting to monitor activation of postulated pathway components, and ex vivo whole-cell patch clamp recording of excitatory post-synaptic currents in corticostriatal slices from mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for MS, to study synaptic transmission. We show that exposure to MMF switches the molecular and functional phenotype of activated microglia from classically activated, pro-inflammatory type to alternatively activated, neuroprotective one, through activation of the hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2). We validate a downstream pathway mediated through the AMPK-Sirt1 axis resulting in deacetylation, and thereby inhibition, of NF-<ce><ba>B and, consequently, of secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules. We demonstrate through ex vivo monitoring of spontaneous glutamate-mediated excitatory post-synaptic currents of single neurons in corticostriatal slices from EAE mice that the neuroprotective effect of DMF was exerted on neurons at pre-synaptic terminals by modulating glutamate release. By exposing control slices to untreated and MMF-treated activated microglia, we confirm the modulating effect of MMF on microglia function and, thereby, its indirect neuroprotective effect at post-synaptic level. These findings, whereby DMF-induced activation of a new HCAR2-dependent pathway on microglia leads to the modulation of neuroinflammation and restores synaptic alterations occurring in EAE, represent a possible novel mechanism of action for DMF in MS.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","C57BL/6","female","7","Dimethyl fumarate","control",1,NA,"2",2,20,0.1,3,20,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"unclear","unclear","unclear","unclear","low","unclear","unclear","unclear","unclear","high",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","30","not reported","0","mice","38","mouse","5","female","histology","behaviour","not reported","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,"auccelli@neurologia.unige.it","13","82","153","150","876","153 - 876","1 - 1306"

However, when concentrations of IFNgamma and/or TNFalpha having no deleterious effects per se on cell viability were added together with cuprizone, cell viability decreased significantly. In mitochondria isolated from cuprizone-treated glial cells, we observed a marked decrease in the activities of the various complexes of the respiratory chain, indicating a disruption of mitochondrial function. An enhancement in oxidant production was also observed in cuprizone and/or TNFalpha-treated oligodendroglial cells. In in vivo experiments, inhibition of microglial activation with minocycline prevented cuprizone-induced demyelination.

In the TMEV-IDD model, we showed that teriflunomide has both anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, but there seemed to be no impact on disability progression and intrathecal antibody production. Notably, benefits in TMEV-IDD were mostly mediated by effects on various cytokines produced in the CNS.

Although the pathophysiology of progression in SPMS and primary progressive MS (PPMS) is thought to be similar, fingolimod, the prototype S1P(1,3,45) agonist, failed to show efficacy against disability progression in PPMS. Differentiating siponimod from fingolimod at the level of their central effects is believed to be the key to a better understanding of the underlying characteristics that could make siponimod uniquely efficacious in progressive MS (PMS). METHODS: Here, we compared the central vs. peripheral dose-dependent drug exposures for siponimod and fingolimod in healthy mice and mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). RESULTS: Siponimod treatment achieved dose-dependent efficacy and dose-proportional increases in steady-state drug blood levels, with a central nervous system (CNS)/blood drug-exposure ratio ((CNS/blood)DER) of ~ 6 in both healthy and EAE mice. In contrast, fingolimod treatments achieved dose-proportional increases in fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate blood levels, with respective (CNS/blood)DER that were markedly increased (≥ threefold) in EAE vs. healthy mice.

A new generation of spontaneous experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse models has been developed that mimic certain aspects of multiple sclerosis spectrum disorders. We assessed the effects of GA in the opticospinal encephalomyelitis model, which involves MOG35-55 peptide-specific T cells and B cells. A nonsignificant trend toward lower disease incidence was found for GA treatment (started on postnatal day 20). Immunohistochemical evaluations revealed no significant differences for inflammatory lesions and demyelination, cytokine production, proliferation, and cell surface markers of immune cells between GA-treated and PBS-treated (control) mice. Although a good correlation was found between the disease score of individual mice and some readout parameters (eg, immunohistochemical staining), this was not the case for others (eg, IFN-<ce><b3> production). It seems plausible that a major effect of GA lies on alternative immunological pathways, such as initiating of an immune response that is not sufficiently reflected in this spontaneous experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model. Thus, the main advantage of the opticospinal encephalomyelitis model in our hands lies in the elucidation of factors influencing the onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eg, susceptibility factors). The model seems less suitable for investigation of disease severity modifications after therapeutic interventions.","no",NA,"IEB",1,NA,"OSE","mouse","TCRMOGxIgHMOG",NA,NA,"Glatiramer acetate","control",1,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"opticospinal encephalomyelitis (OSE)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","24","not reported","0","mice","32","mouse","6","not reported","histology","behaviour","not reported","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,"c(""stefan-bittner@gmx.de"", ""meuth@ukmuenster.de"")","1","1","135","346","404","135 - 404","1 - 577"

FTY720 enhanced myelin repair and up-regulated the expression levels of Olig2 and MBP. Additionally, the expression levels of HDAC1 and S1PR1 were significantly reduced in animals treated with FTY720. In contrast to FTY720 treated animals, administration of VPA could not significantly improve the functional recovery of optic pathway following LPC injection.

OBJECTIVE: Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) with DMF were developed for subcutaneous administration. METHODS: DMF-incorporated SLNs and free DMF were tested in mice induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). RESULTS: Preventive treatment of free or incorporated DMF were able to reduce the EAE clinical scores, increase the weight of the animals, reduce the lesion area (demyelination and infiltration), reduce microglial fluorescence intensity and reduce the number of microglial cells and astrocytes, when compared to untreated EAE animals. Groups that received DMF had reduced numbers of T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells in the blood, when compared to the non-induced group. CONCLUSIONS: DMF incorporated in SLNs was as effective as free DMF in reducing the clinical scores of the animals, but with reduced administrations when given subcutaneously.

The strong immunomodulatory potency of TX527 is reflected by its ability to attenuate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of multiple sclerosis (MS). At present most MS patients are being treated with systemic IFN-beta administration. The aim of this study was to investigate whether combining IFN-beta with TX527 could empower its EAE-protective effects. We evaluated also combinations with the standard immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA). EAE was induced in SJL mice by PLP immunization, treatment was started 3 days before disease induction. The TX527+IFN-beta combination resulted in significant disease protection which was superior to the effect of both treatment separately. No disease amelioration, even aggravation, was obtained with the IFN-beta+CsA combination. By adding TX527 to the IFN-beta+CsA combination near complete protection from EAE was achieved (100% protection from paralysis, mean maximal score of 1.8+/-1.5, both p<0.05 versus controls and all individual treatments).

The remyelination process is mediated by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that Fingolimod, a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, stimulates OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes, in addition to its well-known anti-inflammatory effect. Using an animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we performed a dose-response study of Fingolimod (0.15 or 0.3mg/kg bw), which was initiated on the day of EAE onset. The neurological function was tested to determine the optimal dose of Fingolimod. Immunofluorescent staining was performed to measure the profile of OPC proliferation and differentiation. The mechanistic premise underlying the therapeutic effect of Fingolimod, was that Fingolimod stimulates the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway, and this pathway promotes OPC differentiation. To test this hypothesis, a loss-of-function study using cyclopamine, an inhibitor of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway, was employed in vivo. Protein levels of the Shh pathway were measured by Western blot analysis. We found that Fingolimod treatment (0.3mg/kg bw) significantly decreased cumulative disease score compared to the EAE control group. Concurrently, OPCs and proliferation of OPCs were significantly increased in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord at day 7 and day 30 after EAE onset, and oligodendrocytes, myelination and differentiation of OPCs were significantly increased at day 30 compared with the EAE control group. EAE mice treated with Fingolimod exhibited substantially elevated levels of Shh, its receptor Smoothened and effector Gli1 in the white matter of the CNS. However, combination treatment of EAE mice with cyclopamine-Fingolimod decreased Fingolimod monotherapy elevated protein levels of Smoothened and Gli1, and abolished the effect of Fingolimod on OPC proliferation and differentiation, as well as on neurological function outcome. Together, these data demonstrate that Fingolimod is effective as a treatment of EAE by promoting OPC proliferation and differentiation, which facilitate remyelination. In addition, the Shh pathway likely contributes to the therapeutic effects of Fingolimod on OPCs.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","SJL",NA,"7","Fingolimod","control",1,NA,"2",1.4,10,NA,2.4,16,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"cumulative EAE score used for further analysis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","68","not reported","0","mice","36","dog","1","female","histology","behaviour","not reported","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,"jingz@neuro.hfh.edu","16","44","123","223","401","123 - 401","1 - 718"

The cuprizone (CPZ) model for the CNS de/remyelination has gained a renewed interest during the past decade. CPZ-induced demyelination is considered to be primarily an oligodendrocyte loss with participation of the inflammatory response. As the blood brain barrier remains intact, we found this model advantageous for studying GA effects on CNS remyelination with minimum influence of the peripheral immune cellular component. Our results show that GA, given one week before the CPZ treatment, had a maturational effect functional to remyelination. However, myelin was unorganized as compared to controls. When GA was concomitantly injected with CPZ, oligodendroglial precursor proliferation diminished in favor of maturation and myelin recovered an organized disposition. GA-treated animals also show microglial cell (MG) activation. In vitro assays demonstrated that GA-primed MG cultures had a significant increase in IL-10 and IL-4 secretion. GA-challenged MG-conditioned media induced oligodendrocyte proliferation and subsequent differentiation.

Notably, the 3-piperidinopropyloxy moiety resembles a structural motif of pitolisant, a drug with histamine H(3)R antagonistic/inverse agonist activity approved for the treatment of narcolepsy. Both novel compounds exerted H(3)R affinities, and in addition, ST-1505 was characterised as a dual S1P(1+3) agonist, whereas ST-1478 was a dual S1P(1+5) agonist. Both multitargeting compounds were also active in mice and reduced the lymphocyte numbers as well as diminished disease symptoms in the mouse model of MS. The effect of ST-1478 was dependent on SK-2 activity suggesting that it is a prodrug like FTY720, but with a more selective S1P receptor activation profile, whereas ST-1505 is a fully active drug even in the absence of SK-2.

The investigation of iNOS expression during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) of the Lewis rat demonstrated iNOS immunoreactivity and mRNA both during inflammatory bursts (days 12 and 23 post-immunization) and during the remission phase (day 18). iNOS expression was region-specific and expanded with time along a caudo-rostral axis, thus, correlating with the development of inflammatory infiltrates. Whereas cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage continuously contributed to iNOS expression, astrocytes only expressed iNOS immunoreactivity or mRNA during the relapse (day 23). In order to investigate possible regulatory effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3) on iNOS expression, rats were treated with the hormone after the beginning of clinical signs (days 11, 13, 19, 21 and 23 post-immunization), and areas of the CNS were examined at day 23. 1,25-D3 exerted a drastic inhibitory effect on iNOS expression, both at the protein and the mRNA levels. However, this effect was region-specific, and was most pronounced in the cerebellum and brainstem, but non-existent in cerebral cortex. iNOS down-regulation occurred in macrophages, activated microglia and astrocytes. The inhibition of iNOS expression in some CNS structures could account for the improvement of clinical signs observed in EAE-rats treated with 1,25-D3. Since 1,25-D3 can be synthesized by activated macrophages or microglia, our results support the hypothesis that this hormone might be implicated in the control of the CNS-specific immune responses. 1,25-D3 or its analogues could, thus, be of therapeutic value in the management of iNOS-associated diseases of the CNS.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","rat","Lewis","female","8.5","Vitamin D3","control",1,37,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"rat","Failed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","47","not reported","0","rats","51","mouse","5","female","histology","behaviour","not reported","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,NA,"14","31","112","42","505","112 - 505","1 - 810"

Additionally, the minocycline concentration in CSF was determined using quantitative matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS) in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. Fifty percent of the minocycline-treated EAE animals did not show neurological symptoms on day 14 (""responders""), while the other half displayed neurological symptoms (""nonresponders""), indicating that minocycline delayed disease onset and attenuated disease severity in some, but not all, animals. Neither CSF nor plasma minocycline concentrations correlated with the onset of symptoms or disease severity. Analysis of the proteomics data resulted in a list of 20 differentially abundant proteins between the untreated animals and the responder group of animals. Two of these proteins, complement C3 and carboxypeptidase B2, were validated by quantitative LC-MS/MS in the SRM mode. Differences in the CSF proteome between untreated EAE animals and minocycline-treated responders were similar to the differences between minocycline-treated responders and nonresponders (70% overlap).

Currently, injection-site problems and unfavorable daily injection are the most common milestones in administration of GA. So that, the design of improved drug delivery systems with sustained release profile seem necessary and helpful in order to minimize GA adverse effects and improve patients' compliance. In this study, we have manufactured a novel chitosan-PLGA (poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)) hydrogel-microparticles containing GA by double emulsion method.

In vivo efficacy of GA-hydrogel-microparticles was evaluated in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as an established animal model for MS. Pathological studies were performed through H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) staining of brain, spine, liver, skin and kidney tissues. Luxol fast blue staining of brain tissue was also done. The obtained results were applied for safety and efficacy evaluations. GA loading and Entrapment efficiency (EE %) of 60% and 95% were achieved, respectively. In- vitro release studies confirms a sustained release profile for GA-hydrogel-microparticles.

Data from in vivo MRI and post-mortem studies in MS indicate that the hippocampus is targeted. However, the relationship between structural pathology and dysfunction of the hippocampus in MS remains unclear. Hippocampal neuropathology also occurs in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the most commonly used animal model of MS. Although estrogen treatment of EAE has been shown to be anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective in the spinal cord, it is unknown if estrogen treatment may prevent hippocampal pathology and dysfunction. In the current study we examined excitatory synaptic transmission during EAE and focused on pathological changes in synaptic protein complexes known to orchestrate functional synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. We then determined if estriol, a candidate hormone treatment, was capable of preventing functional changes in synaptic transmission and corresponding hippocampal synaptic pathology. Electrophysiological studies revealed altered excitatory synaptic transmission and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) during EAE. Neuropathological experiments demonstrated that there were decreased levels of pre- and post-synaptic proteins in the hippocampus, diffuse loss of myelin staining and atrophy of the pyramidal layers of hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1). Estriol treatment prevented decreases in excitatory synaptic transmission and lessened the effect of EAE on PPF. In addition, estriol treatment prevented several neuropathological alterations that occurred in the hippocampus during EAE. Cross-modality correlations revealed that deficits in excitatory synaptic transmission were significantly correlated with reductions in trans-synaptic protein binding partners known to modulate excitatory synaptic transmission. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a functional correlate to hippocampal neuropathology in any MS model. Furthermore, a treatment was identified that prevented both deficits in synaptic function and hippocampal neuropathology.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","C57BL/6","female","14","Estriol","control",1,NA,"0",0.3,5,0.1,4,5,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Failed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","120","not reported","0","mice","64","mouse","4","female","histology","behaviour","not reported","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,"rvoskuhl@ucla.edu","1","1","92","241","454","92 - 454","1 - 824"

This is reflected biologically by improved axonal integrity, as confirmed by magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, and by newly formed myelin sheaths, as determined by electron microscopy.

The extent of B cell depletion and kinetics of their recovery in different immune compartments is largely unknown. Here, we studied how anti-CD20 treatment influences B cells in bone marrow, blood, lymph nodes, and spleen in models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Anti-CD20 reduced mature B cells in all compartments examined, although a subpopulation of antigen-experienced B cells persisted in splenic follicles. Upon treatment cessation, CD20(+) B cells simultaneously repopulated in bone marrow and spleen before their reappearance in blood. In EAE induced by native myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), a model in which B cells are activated, B cell recovery was characterized by expansion of mature, differentiated cells containing a high frequency of myelin-reactive B cells with restricted B cell receptor gene diversity.

Although there are potent disease-modifying agents for its initial relapsing-remitting phase, immunosuppressive therapies show limited efficacy in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Although modulation of sphingosine-1 phosphate receptors has proven beneficial during SPMS, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this project, we followed the hypothesis that siponimod, a sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor modulator, exerts protective effects by direct modulation of glia cell function (i.e., either astrocytes, microglia, or oligodendrocytes). To this end, we used the toxin-mediated, nonautoimmune MS animal model of cuprizone (Cup) intoxication. On the histological level, siponimod ameliorated cuprizone-induced oligodendrocyte degeneration, demyelination, and axonal injury. Protective effects were evident as well using GE180 translocator protein 18-kDa (TSPO) imaging with positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging or next generation sequencing (NGS). Siponimod also ameliorated the cuprizone-induced pathologies in Rag1-deficient mice, demonstrating that the protection is independent of T and B cell modulation. Proinflammatory responses in primary mixed astrocytes/microglia cell cultures were not modulated by siponimod, suggesting that other cell types than microglia and astrocytes are targeted. Of note, siponimod completely lost its protective effects in S1pr5-deficient mice, suggesting direct protection of degenerating oligodendrocytes. Our study demonstrates that siponimod exerts protective effects in the brain in a S1PR5-dependent manner. This finding is not just relevant in the context of MS but in other neuropathologies as well, characterized by a degeneration of the axon-myelin unit.","no",NA,"IEB",1,NA,"Cup/EAE","mouse","C57BL/6","female","10","Siponimod","control",1,NA,NA,0,8,0,3,10,0.17,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cup/EAE combined model",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"unclear","unclear","unclear","unclear","unclear","low","unclear","unclear","unclear","high",NA,NA,NA,"cuprizone","9","EAE","3","mice","13","mouse","3","female","histology","not reported","not reported","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","10.1073/pnas.2204509119","markus.kipp@med.uni-rostock.de","1","1","349","84","255","349 - 521","1 - 521"

Microglia play a critical role in major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II)-dependent antigen presentation and in reactivation of CNS-infiltrated encephalitogenic T cells. Minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, has profound anti-inflammatory properties and is experimentally used for treatment of many CNS disorders; however, the mechanisms involved in minocycline effects remain unknown. We show that administration of minocycline for 2 weeks ameliorated clinical severity of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, an effect that partially involves the down-regulation of MHC II proteins in the spinal cord. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of minocycline inhibitory effects on MHC II expression in microglia. Although complex, the co-activator class II transactivator (CIITA) is a key regulator of MHC II expression. Here we show that minocycline inhibited interferon <ce><b3> (IFN<ce><b3>)-induced CIITA and MHC II mRNA. Interestingly, however, it was without effect on STAT1 phosphorylation or IRF-1 expression, transcription factors that are activated by IFN<ce><b3> and necessary for CIITA expression. Further experiments revealed that MHC II expression is down-regulated in the presence of the PKC<ce><b1> inhibitor G<c3><b6>6976. Minocycline inhibited IFN<ce><b3>-induced PKC <ce><b1>/<ce><b2>II phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of both PKC<ce><b1>/<ce><b2>II and IRF-1 that subsequently inhibits CIITA expression. Our present data delineate a molecular pathway of minocycline action that includes inhibitory effects on PKC<ce><b1>/<ce><b2>II and transcription factors that regulate the expression of critical inflammatory genes such as MHC II.

Pathogenesis may be antibody independent, as B cell depletion therapy (BCDT) leads to amelioration of disease irrespective of autoantibody ablation. However, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. We demonstrate that BCDT alleviates central nervous system autoimmunity through ablation of IL-6-secreting pathogenic B cells. B cells from mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) secreted elevated levels of IL-6 compared with B cells from naive controls, and mice with a B cell-specific IL-6 deficiency showed less severe disease than mice with wild-type B cells. Moreover, BCDT ameliorated EAE only in mice with IL-6-sufficient B cells. This mechanism of pathogenesis may also operate in multiple sclerosis (MS) because B cells from MS patients produced more IL-6 than B cells from healthy controls, and this abnormality was normalized with B cell reconstitution after Rituximab treatment. This suggests that BCDT improved disease progression, at least partly, by eliminating IL-6-producing B cells in MS patients.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was induced in 14 marmosets by immunization with recombinant human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein in complete Freund adjuvant. At 21 days after immunization, B-cell depletion was achieved by weekly intravenous injections of HuMab 7D8, a human-anti-human CD20 antibody that cross-reacts with marmoset CD20. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging showed widespread brain white matter demyelination in control marmosets that was absent in CD20 antibody-treated marmosets. High-contrast postmortem magnetic resonance imaging showed white matter lesions in 4of the 7 antibody-treated marmosets, but these were significantly smaller than those in controls. The same technique revealed gray matter lesions in 5 control marmosets, but none in antibody-treated marmosets. Histologic analysis confirmed that inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage were substantially reduced in brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves of CD20 antibody-treated marmosets. In conclusion, CD20-postive B-cell depletion by HuMab 7D8 profoundly reduced the development of both white and gray matter lesions in the marmoset CNS.

Here, we evaluated the potential of an agonist at this receptor, FTY720 (fingolimod), to activate the promyelinating pathways within the brain to encourage remyelination and neuroprotection. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In this study, we used the cuprizone model in male C57BL/6 mice and tested the promyelinating and neuroprotective effects of FTY720 after acute and chronic toxin-induced experimental demyelination. We used histological, immunohistochemical and gene expression methods. KEY RESULTS: The midline of the corpus callosum was severely demyelinated after acute and chronic cuprizone-induced demyelination. Robust endogenous remyelination was evident after acute, but impaired after chronic, demyelination. FTY720 treatment modestly accelerated myelin recovery after acute but not chronic cuprizone exposure. Markers of gliosis (astrocyte and microglia activation) were not affected by FTY720 treatment. Remarkably, the accumulation of amyloid precursor protein-positive spheroids in axons was less distinct in FTY720-treated animals, indicating that this compound alleviated ongoing axonal damage. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We show that even during endogenous remyelination, axonal degeneration continued at a low level, accumulating over time.

METHODS: We treated monophasic experimental autoimmune EAE, induced in Lewis rat, with vitamin D3 and adoptively transfer tolerogenic bone marrow-derived DCs generated in the presence of vitamin D3. RESULTS: This study provides evidence that the in vivo administration of vitamin D3, as well as the adoptive transfer of vitamin D3 -induced IDO(+) immature/tolerogenic dendritic cells, leads to a significant increase in the percentage of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in the lymph nodes in a rat model of MS, experimental autoimmune EAE. Concomitant with the increase in this cell population, there is a significant decrease in the number of autoreactive T cells in the central nervous system. Bone marrow-derived DCs cultivated in the presence of vitamin D3 present a tolerogenic profile with high IL-10, TNF<ce><b1>, and IDO expression and decreased MHC-II and CD80 expression. The adoptive transfer of IDO (+) DCs induces a significant increase in the percentage of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) T cells in the lymph nodes, comparable with vitamin D3 treatment.

As an antigen-based therapy, GA induces GA-specific antibodies in treated patients and animals. GA-specific antibodies do not neutralize therapeutic effects on relapses and disability. Rather, it has been suggested that GA-specific antibodies may be associated with improved clinical outcomes. We evaluated antibody responses in eight patients with RRMS treated with GA for 15months and antibody responses in GA-treated C57BL/6 mice before and after induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). There were no significant differences from pretreatment levels of total IgE or GA-specific IgE in patients with RRMS. Total IgG1, IgG3 and GA-specific IgG4 were significantly increased at 15months of GA treatment. Antibody type and titre were not associated with clinical outcomes, i.e. expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score, disease burden on magnetic resonance images (MRI) or clinical relapses. In contrast, mice with EAE showed a marked increase in GA-specific IgE and GA-specific IgG1 antibody responses. GA-treated mice demonstrated improved clinical symptoms and lower mortality than untreated controls. Our results suggest that antibody responses to GA are heterogeneous among patients with RRMS, with no apparent association between antibody response and clinical outcomes. Clinical improvements in EAE-induced GA-treated mice suggest that GA-specific IgE and IgG1 may contribute to GA treatment effects in EAE. <c2><a9> 2011 The Authors.

Fingolimod is an effective orally active agent for the treatment of MS, affecting lymphocyte invasion of the brain. However, it is still unclear if fingolimod can be neuroprotective in this disorder. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Using neurophysiological recordings and morphological evaluation of dendritic integrity, we evaluated the effects of oral fingolimod on the clinical score of EAE mice in order to determine whether the compound was associated with preservation of synaptic transmission. KEY RESULTS Oral fingolimod prevented and reversed the pre- and postsynaptic alterations of glutamate transmission in EAE mice. These effects were associated with a clear amelioration of the clinical deterioration seen in EAE mice, and with a significant inhibition of neuronal dendritic pathology. Fingolimod did not alter the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in control animals, suggesting that only the pathological processes behind the inflammation-induced defects in glutamate transmission were modulated by this compound. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The beneficial effects of fingolimod on the clinical, synaptic and dendritic abnormalities of murine EAE might correlate with the neuroprotective actions of this agent, as observed in MS patients.

S1P1 receptors are essential for lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes and a drug target in immune-mediated diseases. Here, we have characterized the immunomodulatory potential of BAF312 and the S1P receptor-mediated effects on heart rate using preclinical and human data. Experimental approach: BAF312 was tested in a rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Electrophysiological recordings of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels were carried out in human atrial myocytes. A Phase I multiple-dose trial studied the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of BAF312 in 48 healthy subjects. KEY RESULTS BAF312 effectively suppressed EAE in rats by internalizing S1P 1 receptors, rendering them insensitive to the egress signal from lymph nodes. In healthy volunteers, BAF312 caused preferential decreases in CD4+ T cells, Tna<c3><af>ve, Tcentral memory and B cells within 4-6 h. Cell counts returned to normal ranges within a week after stopping treatment, in line with the elimination half-life of BAF312. Despite sparing S1P3 receptors (associated with bradycardia in mice), BAF312 induced rapid, transient (day 1 only) bradycardia in humans. BAF312-mediated activation of GIRK channels in human atrial myocytes can fully explain the bradycardia. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS This study illustrates species-specific differences in S1P receptor specificity for first-dose cardiac effects. Based on its profound but rapidly reversible inhibition of lymphocyte trafficking, BAF312 may have potential as a treatment for immune-mediated diseases. <c2><a9> 2012 The British Pharmacological Society.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","rat","Dark Agouti",NA,"9","Siponimod","control",1,48,"2",0.3,9,0.2,2.7,12,0.2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"all the other data is given in mean, but there are sd and sem values in the paper- bradycardia reported in humans, although the drug sparing S1P3 receptor which is associated with bradycardia in mice",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"rat","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","10","not reported","0","rats","7","mouse","4","female and male","not reported","behaviour","not reported","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","not reported","10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.02061.x","peter.gergely@novartis.com","1","70","130","50","647","130 - 647","1 - 912"

The exact mechanism of action by which teriflunomide exerts these effects is currently unknown. We assessed the effect of teriflunomide on brain glial cells in the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) by using a histological approach in combination with neuroimaging. METHODS: Forty-eight SJL female mice received an intracerebral injection of TMEV at 6-8 weeks of age and were then treated with teriflunomide (n = 24) or placebo (n = 24) for 9 months. They were examined with MRI and behavioral testing at 2, 6, and 9 months postinduction (mPI). Of those, 18 teriflunomide-treated and 17 controls mice were analyzed histologically at 9 mPI to sample from different brain regions for myelination status, microglial density, and oligodendroglial lineage. The histological and MRI outcomes were correlated. RESULTS: Corpus callosum microglial density was numerically lower in the teriflunomide-treated mice compared to the control group (141.1 <c2><b1> 21.7 SEM vs. 214.74 <c2><b1> 34.79 SEM, Iba1(+) cells/mm(2) , P = .087). Basal ganglia (BG) microglial density in the teriflunomide group exhibited a negative correlation with fractional anisotropy (P = .021) and a positive correlation with mean diffusivity (P = .034), indicating less inflammation and axonal damage. Oligodendroglial lineage cell and myelin density were not significantly different between treatment groups. However, a significant positive correlation between BG oligodendrocytes and BG volume (P = .027), and with N-acetyl aspartate concentration (P = .008), was found in the teriflunomide group, indicating less axonal loss. CONCLUSION: Teriflunomide altered microglia density and oligodendrocytes differentiation, which was associated with less evident microstructural damage on MRI.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"TMEV-IDD","mouse","SJL","female","7","Teriflunomide","control",1,48,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"TMEV","6","not reported","0","mice","6","rabbit","4","female","histology","behaviour","imaging","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","10.1111/jon.12561","rzivadinov@bnac.net","8","46","140","197","426","140 - 426","1 - 638"

Fingolimod, a nonselective sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist that induces sustained lymphopenia and accumulates in the CNS, represents a new treatment modality for MS. We hypothesized that sustained lymphopenia would not be required for efficacy and that a selective, CNS-penetrant, peripherally short-acting, S1P(1) agonist would show full efficacy in a mouse MS model. Using daily treatment with 10 mg/kg 2-(4-(5-(3,4-diethoxyphenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-yl amino)ethanol (CYM-5442) at the onset of clinical signs in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein MOG(35-55)- induced experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), we assessed clinical scores, CNS cellular infiltration, demyelination, and gliosis for 12 days with CYM-5442, vehicle, or fingolimod. CYM-5442 levels in CNS and plasma were determined at experiment termination, and blood lymphopenia was measured 3 and 24 h after the last injection. Plasma levels of cytokines were assayed at the end of the protocol. Changes in S1P(1)-enhanced green fluorescent protein expression on neurons and astrocytes during active EAE and upon CYM-5442 treatment were quantified with flow cytometry and Western blotting by using native-locus enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged S1P(1) mice. S1P(1) agonism alone reduced pathological features as did fingolimod (maximally lymphopenic throughout), despite full reversal of lymphopenia within each dosing interval. CYM-5442 levels in CNS but not in plasma were sustained. Neuronal and astrocytic S1P(1) expression in EAE was suppressed by CYM-5442 treatment, relative to vehicle, and levels of key cytokines, such as interleukin 17A, were also significantly reduced in drug-treated mice.

The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], has a direct repressive effect on the expression of IL-17A in both human and mouse T cells. In vivo treatment of mice with ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a mouse model of multiple sclerosis) diminishes paralysis and progression of the disease and reduces IL-17A-secreting CD4(+) T cells in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS). The mechanism of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) repression of IL-17A expression was found to be transcriptional repression, mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Transcription assays, gel shifting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicate that the negative effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on IL-17A involves blocking of nuclear factor for activated T cells (NFAT), recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC), sequestration of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)/VDR, and a direct effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on induction of Foxp3.

Microglia play an important role in neuroinflammation. The M1 phenotype of microglia is involved in the proinflammatory process of the disease, while the M2 phenotype plays an anti-inflammatory role. Promoting the polarization of microglia to M2 in MS/EAE is a promising therapeutic strategy. This study is aimed at exploring the effects of BSYS on microglial polarization in mice with EAE. METHODS: The EAE model was established by the intraperitoneal injection of pertussis toxin and subcutaneous injection of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)(35-55) in C57BL/6J mice. The mice were treated with BSYS (3.02<e2><80><89>g/kg), FTY720 (0.3<e2><80><89>mg/kg), or distilled water by intragastric administration. H&E and LFB staining, transmission electron microscopy, qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, ELISA, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and western blotting were used to detect the histological changes in myelin, microglial M1/M2 polarization markers, and the expression of key genes involved in EAE. Results and Conclusions. BSYS treatment of EAE mice increased the body weight, decreased the clinical score, and reduced demyelination induced by inflammatory infiltration. BSYS also inhibited the mRNA expression of M1 microglial markers while increasing the mRNA level of M2 markers. Additionally, BSYS led to a marked decrease in the ratio of M1 microglia (iNOS(+)/Iba1(+)) and an obvious increase in the number of M2 microglia (Arg1(+)/Iba1(+)). In the EAE mouse model, miR-124 expression was decreased, and miR-155 expression was increased, while BSYS treatment significantly reversed this effect and modulated the levels of C/EBP <ce><b1>, PU.1, and SOCS1 (target genes of miR-124 and miR-155). Therefore, the neuroprotective effect of BSYS against MS/EAE was related to promoting microglia toward M2 polarization, which may be correlated with changes in miR-124 and miR-155 in vivo.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","C57BL/6","female","7","Fingolimod","control",1,40,"1",3,10,1,6.3,10,0.8,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","158","not reported","0","mice","43","mouse","3","female","histology","behaviour","not reported","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","yes",NA,"tmwangl@ccmu.edu.cn","1","42","115","34","939","115 - 939","1 - 1645"

Among them is the monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab that depletes mainly B cells and T cells in the immune periphery. Considering the ongoing controversy about the involvement of B cells and in particular the formation of B cell aggregates in the brains of progressive MS patients, an in-depth understanding of the effects of anti-CD52 antibody treatment on the B cell compartment in the CNS itself is desirable. METHODS: We used myelin basic protein (MBP)-proteolipid protein (PLP)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6 (B6) mice as B cell-dependent model of MS. Mice were treated intraperitoneally either at the peak of EAE or at 60<c2><a0>days after onset with 200<c2><a0><ce><bc>g murine anti-CD52 vs. IgG2a isotype control antibody for five consecutive days. Disease was subsequently monitored for 10<c2><a0>days. The antigen-specific B cell/antibody response was measured by ELISPOT<c2><a0>and ELISA. Effects on CNS infiltration and B cell aggregation were determined by immunohistochemistry. Neurodegeneration was evaluated by Luxol Fast Blue, SMI-32, and Olig2/APC staining as well as by electron microscopy and phosphorylated heavy neurofilament serum ELISA. RESULTS: Treatment with anti-CD52 antibody attenuated EAE only when administered at the peak of disease. While there was no effect on the production of MP4-specific IgG, the treatment almost completely depleted CNS infiltrates and B cell aggregates even when given as late as 60<c2><a0>days after onset. On the ultrastructural level, we observed significantly less axonal damage in the spinal cord and cerebellum in chronic EAE after anti-CD52 treatment.

Fingolimod is a disease-modifying treatment that belongs to the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators. In addition to inhibiting T cell egress from lymph nodes, fingolimod promotes the immunosuppressive activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), whose monocytic subset (M-MDSCs) can be used as a biomarker of disease severity, as well as the degree of demyelination and extent of axonal damage in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. In the present study, we have assessed whether the abundance of circulating M-MDSCs may represent a useful biomarker of fingolimod efficacy in EAE and in the clinical context of MS patients. METHODS: Treatment with vehicle or fingolimod was orally administered to EAE mice for 14<c2><a0>days in an individualized manner, starting the day when each mouse began to develop clinical signs. Peripheral blood from EAE mice was collected previous to treatment and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from fingolimod to treat MS patients' peripheral blood. In both cases, M-MDSCs abundance was analyzed by flow cytometry and its relationship with the future clinical affectation of each individual animal or patient was assessed. RESULTS: Fingolimod-treated animals presented a milder EAE course with less demyelination and axonal damage, although a few animals did not respond well to treatment and they invariably had fewer M-MDSCs prior to initiating the treatment. Remarkably, M-MDSC abundance was also found to be an important and specific parameter to distinguish EAE mice prone to better fingolimod efficacy. Finally, in a translational effort, M-MDSCs were quantified in MS patients at baseline and correlated with different clinical parameters after 12<c2><a0>months of fingolimod treatment. M-MDSCs at baseline were highly representative of a good therapeutic response to fingolimod, i.e., patients who met at least two of the criteria used to define non-evidence of disease activity-3 (NEDA-3) 12<c2><a0>months after treatment.

Recent studies on schizophrenia have highlighted the involvement of inflammatory and immunoregulatory mechanisms with the onset of symptoms, and the usage of anti-inflammatory treatments are being tested against periods of rapid psychosis. In the central nervous system, microglia are the innate immune population which are activated in response to a wide range of physical and psychological stress factors and produce proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines. Microglial activation and neuroinflammation has been associated to numerous psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, especially during psychotic episodes. Thus, novel treatments which dampen microglial activation may be of great relevance in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Fingolimod (FTY720) is a drug used as an immunosuppressive treatment to multiple sclerosis. Recent clinical trials have focused on FTY720 as a treatment for the behavioral symptoms in schizophrenia. However, the mechanisms of Fingolimod in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia are not clear. In this study we use a recently developed neuroinflammatory psychosis model in mice: cuprizone short-term exposure, to investigate the effects of FTY720 administration. FTY720 administration was able to completely alleviate methamphetamine hypersensitivity caused by cuprizone exposure. Moreover, administration of FTY720 improved multiple measures of neuroinflammation (microglial activation, cytokine production, and leucocyte infiltration).

Here, we sought to study whether the effect of DMF can be detected using positron emission tomography (PET) targeting the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) in the focal delayed-type hypersensitivity rat model of multiple sclerosis (fDTH-EAE). The rats were treated orally twice daily from lesion activation (day 0) with either vehicle (tap water with 0.08% Methocel, 200 <c2><b5>L; control group n<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>4 (3 after week four)) or 15<c2><a0>mg/kg DMF (n<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>4) in 0.08% aqueous Methocel (200 <c2><b5>L) for 8<c2><a0>weeks. The animals were imaged by PET using the TSPO tracer [(18)F]GE-180 in weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 18 following lesion activation, and the non-displaceable binding potential (BP(ND)) was calculated. Immunohistochemical staining for Iba1, CD4, and CD8 was performed in week 18, and in separate cohorts of animals, following 2 or 4<c2><a0>weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Using the fDTH-EAE model, DMF reduced the [(18)F]GE-180 BP(ND) in the DMF-treated animals compared to control animals after 1<c2><a0>week of treatment (two-tailed unpaired t test, p<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>0.031), but not in weeks 2, 4, 8, or 18 when imaged in vivo by PET. Immunostaining for Iba1 showed that DMF had no effect on the perilesional volume or the core lesion volume after 2 or 4<c2><a0>weeks of treatment, or at 18<c2><a0>weeks. However, the optical density (OD) measurements of CD4(+) staining showed reduced OD in the lesions of the treated rats. CONCLUSIONS: DMF reduced the microglial activation in the fDTH-EAE model after 1<c2><a0>week of treatment, as detected by PET imaging of the TSPO ligand [(18)F]GE-180. However, over an extended time course, reduced microglial activation was not observed using [(18)F]GE-180 or by immunohistochemistry for Iba1(+) microglia/macrophages. Additionally, DMF did affect the infiltration of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocytes at the fDTH-EAE lesion.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","rat","Lewis","male",NA,"Dimethyl fumarate","control",1,24,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"rat","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,"y","not reported","0","not reported","0","rats","8","rabbit","1","male","histology","not reported","not reported","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes",NA,"sukakoi@utu.fi","9","1","101","192","448","101 - 448","1 - 881"

MS patients treated with GA developed GA reactive antibodies, which peaked at three months and decreased at six months. In order to find out whether anti-GA antibodies may neutralize the therapeutic effect of GA, we tested both polyclonal (mouse and human) and monoclonal GA specific antibodies for their ability to interfere with the biological activity of GA in several assay systems. None of the antibodies interfered with GA activities either in vitro (binding to MHC molecules and T cell stimulation) or in vivo (blocking of EAE). Furthermore, 53 samples of sera obtained from 34 MS patients that participated in the open label trial in Israel, and all developed GA specific antibodies, were tested for their ability to inhibit the proliferation response of GA specific Ts cell clone and to interfere with GA competitive inhibition of the response to peptide 84-102 of myelin basic protein (MBP). None of the sera inhibited and some even enhanced the in vitro activities of GA. Furthermore, representative MS sera with high titer of GA reactive antibodies did not neutralize the biological activities of GA and did not inhibit Th2 cytokine secretion by human GA specific clone. These results are consistent with the findings that the therapeutic effect of GA is not affected by GA reactive antibodies and is sustained upon long term treatment.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","(SJLxBALB/c)F1","female","9.5","Glatiramer acetate","control",1,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,"2003",NA,"EAE","24","experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","1","mice","16","mouse","5","female","not reported","behaviour","imaging","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","10 3159/835","dvora.teitelbaum@weizmann.ac.il","1","31","120","157","33","120 - 494","1 - 561"

Human neurons were exposed to activated human T lymphocytes and the loss of neurons was documented 24 hours later by counting the number of microtubule-associated protein-2 positive cells. Mice with EAE were harvested for counts of axonal profiles in the spinal cord. 1,25D3 was exposed to T cells in culture or administered to mice from peak EAE clinical severity when axonal loss was already evolving. Activated T lymphocytes killed human neurons prominently within 24 hours but toxicity was significantly attenuated when T cells were exposed to 1,25D3 prior to the co-culture. In EAE, 1,25D3 treatment initiated from peak clinical severity reduced the extent of clinical disability and mitigated the progressive loss of axons.

The most important unmet need in MS is use of treatments that delay the progression of the disease. Leucine-rich repeat and Immunoglobulin-like domain containing NOGO receptor-interacting protein 1(LINGO-1) have been known as inhibitors of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated LINGO-1 antibody effects on remyelination and neurobehavioral deficit using cuprizone-induced demyelination. Animals were randomly divided into three groups (n = 10): (1) Control group; received the regular diet, (2) CPZ group; normal saline was injected intraperitoneally, and (3) Treatment group; LINGO-1 antibody (10 mg/kg) was injected IP once every six days for 3 weeks. We assessed the level of myelin basic protein (MBP), neurofilament heavy chain (NF200), and Brain-derived neuroprotective factor (BDNF) in the corpus callosum (CC) by immunostaining against MBP, NF200, and BDNF. RESULTS: We found decreased levels of MBP, NF200, and BDNF in demyelinated CC, and anti-LINGO-1 treatment improved demyelinated structures. Furthermore, motor impairment was measured by Open-field (OFT) and Balance beam tests. In the treatment group, motor impairment was significantly improved.

While low VitD levels strongly correlate with higher MS risk in white populations, this is not the case for other ethnic groups, suggesting the existence of a genetic component. Moreover, VitD supplementation studies in MS so far have not shown a consistent benefit. We sought to determine whether direct manipulation of VitD levels modulates central nervous system autoimmune disease in a sex-by-genotype-dependent manner. To this end, we used a dietary model of VitD modulation, together with the autoimmune animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). To assess the impact of genotype-by-VitD interactions on EAE susceptibility, we utilized a chromosome substitution (consomic) mouse model that incorporates the genetic diversity of wild-derived PWD/PhJ mice. High VitD was protective in EAE in female, but not male C57BL/6J (B6) mice, and had no effect in EAE-resistant PWD/PhJ (PWD) mice. EAE protection was accompanied by sex- and genotype-specific suppression of proinflammatory transcriptional programs in CD4 T effector cells, but not CD4 regulatory T cells. Decreased expression of proinflammatory genes was observed with high VitD in female CD4 T effector cells, specifically implicating a key role of MHC class II genes, interferon gamma, and Th1<e2><80><89>cell-mediated neuroinflammation. In consomic strains, effects of VitD on EAE were also sex- and genotype dependent, whereby high VitD: (1) was protective, (2) had no effect, and (3) unexpectedly had disease-exacerbating effects. Systemic levels of 25(OH)D differed across consomic strains, with higher levels associated with EAE protection only in females. Analysis of expression of key known VitD metabolism genes between B6 and PWD mice revealed that their expression is genetically determined and sex specific and implicated Cyp27b1 and Vdr as candidate genes responsible for differential EAE responses to VitD modulation. Taken together, our results support the observation that the association between VitD status and MS susceptibility is genotype dependent and suggest that the outcome of VitD status in MS is determined by gene-by-sex interactions.","no",NA,"WZ",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","C57BL/6, PWD, C57BL/6.ChrPWD","both","9","Vitamin D3","control",1,209,"0",1.3,24,0.3,1.9,33,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Scores obtained from B6 strain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Failed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","55","not reported","0","mice","19","mouse","1","female and male","not reported","not reported","not reported","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,"c(""dkrement@uvm.edu"", ""c.teuscher@uvm.edu"")","1","64","209","55","464","209 - 464","1 - 1082"

Possible Implications for the Inflammatory Response","Monomethyl fumarate (MMF), metabolite of dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an immunosuppressive drug approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), is a potent agonist for hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2), eliciting signals that dampen cell activation or lead to inflammation such as the skin flushing reaction that is one of the main side effects of the treatment, together with gastrointestinal inflammation. Our aim is to further understand the molecular basis underlying these differential effects of the drug. We have used wild-type and HCAR2 knock-out mice to investigate, in vitro and ex vivo under steady-state and pathological conditions, the HCAR2-mediated signaling pathways activated by MMF in dendritic cells (DC), which promote differentiation of T cells, and in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) where activation of a pro-inflammatory pathway, such as the cyclooxygenase-2 pathway involved in skin flushing, could underlie gastrointestinal side effects of the drug. To understand how DMF treatment might impact on gut inflammation induced by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model for MS, we have used 3D X-ray phase contrast tomography and flow cytometry to monitor possible intestinal alterations at morphological and immunological levels, respectively. We show that HCAR2 is a pleiotropically linked receptor for MMF, mediating activation of different pathways leading to different outcomes in different cell types, depending on experimental in-vitro and in-vivo conditions. In the small intestine of EAE-affected mice, DMF treatment affected migration of tolerogenic DC from lamina propria to mesenteric lymph nodes, and/or reverted their profile to pro-inflammatory, probably as a result of reduced expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase and transforming growth factor beta as well as the inflammatory environment. Nevertheless, DMF treatment did not amplify the morphological alterations induced by EAE. On the basis of our further understanding of MMF signaling through HCAR2, we suggest that the pleiotropic signaling of fumarate via HCAR2 should be addressed for its pharmaceutical relevance in devising new lead compounds with reduced inflammatory side effects.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","C57BL/6","female","7","Dimethyl fumarate","control",1,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","93","lipopolysaccharide","2","mice","128","mouse","7","female","histology","behaviour","not reported","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","yes",NA,"benedetta.parod@gmail.com","1","63","89","398","778","89 - 778","1 - 1372"

Phycocyanobilin (PCB), a chromophore of the biliprotein C-Phycocyanin (C-PC) from Spirulina platensis, has antioxidant, immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in this disease, and it could complement the effect of other Disease Modifying Treatments (DMT), such as Interferon-<ce><b2> (IFN-<ce><b2>). Here, our main goal was to evaluate the potential PCB benefits and its mechanisms of action to counteract the chronic EAE in mice. MOG(35-55)-induced EAE was implemented in C57BL/6 female mice. Clinical signs, pro-inflammatory cytokines levels by ELISA, qPCR in the brain and immunohistochemistry using precursor/mature oligodendrocytes cells antibodies in the spinal cord, were assessed. PCB enhanced the neurological condition, and waned the brain concentrations of IL-17A and IL-6, pro-inflammatory cytokines, in a dose-dependent manner. A down- or up-regulating activity of PCB at 1 mg/kg was identified in the brain on three (LINGO1, NOTCH1, and TNF-<ce><b1>), and five genes (MAL, CXCL12, MOG, OLIG1, and NKX2-2), respectively. Interestingly, a reduction of demyelination, active microglia/macrophages density, and axonal damage was detected along with an increase in oligodendrocyte precursor cells and mature oligodendrocytes, when assessed the spinal cords of EAE mice that took up PCB. The studies in vitro in rodent encephalitogenic T cells and in vivo in the EAE mouse model with the PCB/IFN-<ce><b2> combination, showed an enhanced positive effect of this combined therapy.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the glial response in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-induced mice treated with a combination of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and pregabalin (PGB). For that, 28 C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to the five experimental groups: na<c3><af>ve, EAE, EAE-DMF, EAE-PGB, and EAE-DMF + PGB. Pharmacological treatments were initiated with the beginning of clinical signs, and all animals were euthanized at 28 dpi for the lumbar spinal cord evaluation.

DMF alone promoted the downregulation of Iba-1 (microglia/macrophages marker) in the ventral horn compared with the non-treated EAE animals (P < 0.05). PGB treatment was associated with reduced Iba-1 immunofluorescence in both the dorsal (P < 0.05) and ventral horn (P < 0.05) compared to EAE vehicle-treated counterparts. However, the combined approach reduced the Iba-1 marker in the dorsal (P < 0.05) and ventral (P < 0.01) horns compared to non-treated EAE animals and further reduced Iba-1 in the ventral horn compared to each drug-alone approach (P < 0.05).

To compare the effect of swimming exercise with interferon-<ce><b2>, a drug for multiple sclerosis, interferon-<ce><b2> was injected intraperitoneally into rats of the EAE-induced and interferon-<ce><b2>-treated group during the exercise period. RESULTS: Injection of MOG33-55 caused weight loss, decreased clinical disability score, and increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators in the lumbar spinal cord. Loss of motor function and weakness increased demyelination score. Swimming exercise suppressed demyelination and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators. These changes promoted recovery of EAE symptoms such as body weight loss, motor dysfunction, and weakness. Swimming exercise caused the same level of improvement as interferon-<ce><b2> treatment. CONCLUSION: The results of this experiment suggest the possibility of swimming exercise in urological diseases that are difficult to treat. Swimming exercises can be considered for relief of symptom in incurable multiple sclerosis.","no",NA,"WZ",1,NA,"EAE","rat","Lewis","female","9","Interferon Beta 1","control",1,40,"1",1.1,8,0.2,2.5,8,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"rat","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","58","experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","2","rats","30","mouse","4","female","histology","behaviour","not reported","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,"rhdlfrb@hanmail.net","1","65","112","42","386","112 - 386","1 - 631"

Here we investigated the role of the crosstalk between sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and cytokine signaling cascades in astrocyte activation and inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration, and addressed the effects of fingolimod on astrocyte-neuron interaction and NO synthesis in vivo. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and confocal microscopy were used to detect S1P receptors, interleukin (IL) 1R, IL17RA, and nitrosative stress in multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) spinal cord, and the spinal cord of fingolimod-treated EAE mice. An in vitro model was established to study the effects of S1P, IL1, and IL17 stimulation on NFkB translocation and NO production in astrocytes, on spinal neuron survival, and on astrocyte-neuron interaction. Furthermore, fingolimod efficacy in blocking astrocyte-mediated neurodegeneration was evaluated. RESULTS: We found coordinated upregulation of IL1R, IL17RA, S1P1, and S1P3 together with nitrosative markers in astrocytes within MS and EAE lesions. In vitro studies revealed that S1P, IL17, and IL1 induced NF<ce><ba>B translocation and NO production in astrocytes, and astrocyte conditioned media triggered neuronal death. Importantly, fingolimod blocked the 2 activation events evoked in astrocytes by either S1P or inflammatory cytokines, resulting in inhibition of astrocyte-mediated neurodegeneration. Finally, therapeutic administration of fingolimod to EAE mice hampered astrocyte activation and NO production.

While all current disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) are very effective at reducing relapses, they do not slow the progression of the disease, and there is little evidence that these treatments are able to repair or remyelinate damaged axons. Recent evidence suggests that activating kappa opioid receptors (KORs) has a beneficial effect on the progression of MS, and this study investigates the effects of KOR agonists treatment in combination with two current DMTs. METHODS: Using the well-established murine model for immune-driven demyelination of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the effect of KOR agonists in combination with DMTs fingolimod or dimethyl fumarate on disease progression, immune cell infiltration and activation as well as myelination were analysed. RESULTS: Fingolimod in combination with the KOR agonist, nalfurafine, significantly increased each individual beneficial effect as measured by increased recovery of mice and reduced relapses. These beneficial effects correlated with a reduction in immune cell infiltration into the CNS as well as peripheral immune cell alterations including a reduction in autoreactive CD4(+) T-cell cytokine production as well as increased myelination in the spinal cords of co-treated animals. In contrast, while the use of dimethyl fumarate in combination with nalfurafine did not adversely affect the benefits of nalfurafine, the combination did not significantly enhance those benefits. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that KOR agonists can be used in combination with fingolimod and dimethyl fumarate with the nalfurafine-fingolimod combination providing enhanced benefits.","no",NA,"BVI",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","C57BL/6","female","10","Fingolimod","control",1,NA,"2",1.1,20,0.15,2,18,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dimethyl fumarate",0,NA,2.4,10,0.2,2.2,9,0.35,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Marketed","Marketed","","","","","","","","","","",NA,"2011",NA,"EAE","3","not reported","0","mouse","5","mice","4","female","histology","behaviour","not reported","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","10.1002/cti2.1480","anne.laflamme@vuw.ac.nz","18","60","1502","37","1104","1502 - 1736","1 - 1868"

In our studies, we describe an alternative approach based on targeting CD79b that induces only partial B-cell depletion and achieves therapeutic effects by B-cell modulation. Prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with an antibody against CD79b and also a deglycosylated variant of this antibody, lacking effector function like antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or complement activation, significantly reduced the development and progression of EAE in mice.

However, the specific subtype of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors that mediates the effect of FTY720 on the CNS cells has not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) is elevated in reactive astrocytes in an autoimmunity independent mouse model of MS and that selective S1PR1 modulation is sufficient to ameliorate the loss of oligodendrocytes and demyelination. The non-selective S1PR modulator, FTY720, or a short-lived S1PR1-specific modulator, CYM5442, was administered daily to mice while on cuprizone diet. Both FTY720- and CYM5422-treated mice displayed a significant reduction in oligodendrocyte apoptosis and astrocyte and microglial activation in comparison to vehicle-treated groups, which was associated with decreased production of proinflammatory mediators and down-regulation of astrocytic S1PR1 protein. Interestingly, S1PR1 modulation during the early phase of cuprizone intoxication was required to suppress oligodendrocyte death and consequent demyelination as drug treatment from 10 days after the initiation of cuprizone feeding was no longer effective. CYM5442 treatment during the brief cuprizone exposure significantly prevented Il-1<ce><b2>, Il-6, Cxcl10, and Cxcl3 induction, resulting in suppression of subsequent reactive gliosis and demyelination. Our study identifies functional antagonism of S1PR1 as a major mechanism for the protective effect of FTY720 in the cuprizone model and suggests pathogenic contributions of astrocyte S1PR1 signaling in primary demyelination and its potential as a therapeutic target for CNS inflammation.","no",NA,"WZ",1,NA,"cuprizone","mouse","C57BL/6","male","8.5","Fingolimod","control",1,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"cuprizone","69","EAE","1","mice","52","mouse","3","male","histology","not reported","not reported","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","10.1002/glia.23272","jrli@cvm.tamu.edu","11","44","119","311","607","119 - 607","1 - 1108"

MR imaging is important for the diagnosis of MS and for the evaluation of potential new therapies. In this study, T2-weighted and T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MR imaging was used to evaluate the effectiveness of an antiadhesion therapy in EAE. Leukocyte-endothelial adhesion at the blood-brain barrier is considered an essential step in the mediation of CNS leukocyte infiltration in EAE. AN100226m, a monoclonal antibody to alpha 4 integrin has been previously shown to reverse the clinical and histologic signs of EAE by blocking this interaction. In the present study, AN100226m treatment in acute EAE significantly decreased contrast enhancement of the CNS parenchyma indicating closure of the blood-brain barrier. The percentage of pixels due to leakage of contrast material in T1-weighted images decreased to < 4% in AN100226m-treated animals whereas it was increased to 15% in control animals (P < .05, Mann-Whitney rank sum test). A decrease in CNS abnormalities associated with cerebral edema and inflammation was also observed on T2-weighted images (P < .05, Mann-Whitney rank sum test). Thus, an antibody to alpha 4 integrin reversed the blood-brain barrier permeability changes characteristic of acute EAE.

T cell apoptosis was detected by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections of spinal cord, using morphological criteria and TUNEL staining. Double labeling of immune cells was done for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and metalloproteinase (MMP) 2. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was visualized by staining for albumin. In severe EAE, an increase of T cell apoptosis was seen after IFN-beta alone (all data presented as mean +/- SD: 24.5% +/- 2.2%, P < 0.05, vs. 19.4% +/- 3.1% in controls), and in combination with MP (29.4% +/- 7.3%, P < 0.05 vs. controls). Only the combination therapy decreased T cell infiltration (53.9 +/- 17.7 cells/mm(2), P < 0.05, vs. 99.5 +/- 35.2 cells/mm2 in controls). In moderate EAE, the rate of T cell apoptosis was slightly increased after IFN-beta (21.2% +/- 5.2% vs. 17.4% +/- 5.0% in controls), whereas MP alone (25.5% +/- 3.5%, P < 0.01 vs. controls) and the combination therapy (22.4% +/- 4.8%, P < 0.05 vs. controls) had a clear augmenting effect.

The mechanisms in the regulation of Th1 response by vitamin D in EAE/MS are, however, not known. We show that in vivo treatment of C57BL/6 and SJL/J mice (i.p.) with 100 ng of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, on every other day from Day 0-30, ameliorates EAE in association with the inhibition of IL-12 production and neural antigen-specific Th1 response.

In this study, we investigated the effects of FTY720 treatment on disease severity and histopathology of MOG-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the dark agouti (DA) rat, a model that closely mimics several features of MS. The effects of FTY720 on T-cell subsets, anti-MOG antibody production, and mRNA expression of a number of cytokines and other genes were also examined. Commencement of treatment before disease onset prevented the appearance of clinical disease. Therapeutic treatment after established disease reduced clinical scores and substantially attenuated inflammation, demyelination, and axon loss. EAE suppression was associated with a reduction in all measured T-cell subsets in blood and spleen and a significant decrease in serum IgG(2a) levels. However, in the lymph nodes, all T-cell subsets except for na<c3><af>ve T cells and recent thymic emigrants remained unaffected. In addition, FTY720 treatment led to a significant inhibition in interferon-gamma, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA expression in the MOG-EAE spinal cord.

We investigated the potential of vitamin D (VD) to enhance GC efficacy and the mechanisms underlying this VD/GC interaction. In vitro, GC receptor (GR) expression levels were quantified by ELISA and induction of T cell apoptosis served as a functional readout to assess synergistic 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (1,25D)/GC effects. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (MOG(35-55) EAE) was induced in mice with T cell-specific GR or mTORc1 deficiency. 25(OH)D (25D) levels were determined in two independent cohorts of MS patients with stable disease or relapses either responsive or resistant to GC treatment (initial cohort: n<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>110; validation cohort: n<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>85). Gene expression of human CD8(+) T cells was analyzed by microarray (n<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>112) and correlated with 25D serum levels. In vitro, 1,25D upregulated GR protein levels, leading to increased GC-induced T cell apoptosis. 1,25D/GC combination therapy ameliorated clinical EAE course more efficiently than respective monotherapies, which was dependent on GR expression in T cells. In MS patients from two independent cohorts, 25D deficiency was associated with GC-resistant relapses. Mechanistic studies revealed that synergistic 1,25D/GC effects on apoptosis induction were mediated by the mTOR but not JNK pathway. In line, 1,25D inhibited mTORc1 activity in murine T cells, and low 25D levels in humans were associated with a reduced expression of mTORc1 inhibiting tuberous sclerosis complex 1 in CD8(+) T cells. GR upregulation by 1,25D and 1,25D/GC synergism in vitro and therapeutic efficacy in vivo were abolished in animals with a T cell-specific mTORc1 deficiency. Specific inhibition of mTORc1 by everolimus increased the efficacy of GC in EAE. 1,25D augments GC-mediated effects in vitro and in vivo in a T cell-specific, GR-dependent manner via mTORc1 inhibition. These data may have implications for improvement of anti-inflammatory GC therapy.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","C57BL/6",NA,NA,"Vitamin D3","control",1,110,"1",4.2,16,0.6,5.6,18,0.5,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Failed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","24","experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","1","mice","21","not reported","NA","not reported","histology","behaviour","not reported","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,"c(""robert.hoepner@insel.ch"", ""andrew.chan@insel.ch"")","11","60","135","345","685","135 - 685","1 - 1108"

An anti-<ce><b1>4 integrin antibody (anti-VLA-4mAb/natalizumab (Tysabri<c2><ae>)) has been used as a treatment for MS and reduces leukocyte influx into the brain. In patients, anti-VLA-4 reduces relapses and disability progression. However, its mechanism of action in the brain is not completely understood. The anti-VLA-4mAb was demonstrated to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells. Interestingly, the chemokine SDF-1/CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 are also key factors regulating the migration of hematopoietic stem cells. Moreover, studies have revealed a crosstalk between SDF-1/CXCR4 and VLA-4 signaling in regulating cell migration. In this study, we address the effects of anti-VLA-4 on chemokine signaling in the brain during MS. We assessed the ability of anti-VLA-4 to regulate Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) and chemokine/receptor signaling. Preclinical administration of anti-VLA-4 delayed clinical signs of EAE. We found that anti-VLA-4 treatment reduced chemokine expression. In order to further explore the interaction of anti-VLA-4 with chemokine/receptor signaling we used dual color transgenic mice. After EAE induction, the expression of both SDF-1/CXCL12 and CXCR4 receptor was upregulated, treatment with anti-VLA-4 inhibited this effect.

Here our aim is to evaluate the effects of C-Phycocyanin (C-Pc), a biliprotein from Spirulina platensis with anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties, in a chronic model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. C-Pc (2, 4 or 8 mg/kg i.p.) or IFN-beta (2000 IU, s.c.) was administered daily once a day or every other day, respectively, starting at disease onset, which differ among EAE mice between 11 and 15 days postinduction. Histological and immunohistochemistry (anti-Mac-3, anti-CD3 and anti-APP) assessments were performed in spinal cord in the postinduction time. Global gene expression in the brain was analyzed with the Illumina Mouse WG-6_V2 BeadChip microarray and the expression of particular genes, assessed by qPCR using the Fast SYBR Green RT-PCR Master Mix. Oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde, peroxidation potential, CAT/SOD ratio and GSH) were determined spectrophoto-metrically. Results showed that C-Pc ameliorates the clinical deterioration of animals, an effect that expresses the reduction of the inflammatory infiltrates invading the spinal cord tissue, the axonal preservation and the down-regulation of IL-17 expression in brain tissue and serum. C-Pc and IFN-beta improved the redox status in mice subjected to EAE, while microarray analysis showed that both treatments shared a common subset of differentially expressed genes, although they also differentially modulated another subset of genes. Specifically, C-Pc mainly modulated the expression of genes related to remyelination, gliogenesis and axon-glia processes. Taken together, our results indicate that C-Pc has significant therapeutic effects against EAE, mediated by the dynamic regulation of multiple biological processes.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","C57BL/6","female","7","Interferon Beta 1","control",1,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","45","not reported","0","mice","10","mouse","1","female","histology","behaviour","not reported","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,"c(""giselle.penton@infomed.sld.cu"", ""jmarin@infomed.sld.cu"", ""nielsen15091984@gmail.com"", ""ivette.raices@cigb.edu.cu"", ""muzio.luca@hsr.it"", ""carmen.valenzuela@cigb.edu.cu"", ""bergami.alessandra@hsr.it"", ""mmtex.ufmg@gmail.com"", ""furlan.roberto@hsr.it"", ""eduardo.penton@cigb.edu.cu"", ""julio.fernandez@cigb.edu.cu"", ""marcelo.nazabal@cigb.edu.cu"", ""alexey.llopiz@cigb.edu.cu"", ""alberto.cintado@cigb.edu.cu"", ""velizrodriguez.tania@hsr.it"", ""nadia.polentarutti@humanitasresearch.it"")","14","106","171","70","565","171 - 565","1 - 1035"

Our study demonstrates that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is upregulated in the serum and spinal cords of EAE rats, but that vitamin D reverses the upregulation to alleviate inflammation. Vitamin D, however, cannot prevent the disease process, suggesting that other factors may be involved. To identify additional factors that might limit vitamin D efficacy, we assessed the effects of vitamin D on plasma gelsolin (pGSN), a regulator of S1P that is downregulated in the CSF of MS patients. Our results show that pGSN is downregulated in the serum of EAE rats, whereas its cellular form, cytoplasmic gelsolin (cGSN), is upregulated in the spinal cord of EAE rats. Importantly, vitamin D causes a downregulation of both pGSN and cGSN, which may counteract the positive effects of S1P decrease. Furthermore, 48 and 42<e2><80><89>kDa caspase-3 cleavage products of cGSN are detected in EAE spinal cords, suggesting enhanced apoptotic activity, but these cleaved products undergo a similar decrease upon vitamin D treatment. To directly test the role of cGSN in the apoptotic process, we performed RNA interference in PC-12, a rat sympathetic nerve cell line.

Collectively, these results support a therapeutic effect of vitamin D that is derived from its ability to reduce S1P, but is limited by its simultaneous effect in reducing pGSN and cGSN.

However, the primary mechanism by which IFN-beta mediates its therapeutic effect remains unclear. Recent studies indicate that under defined conditions, IFN-beta may downregulate DC expression of IL-12. We and others have shown that IFN-beta may also downregulate IL-10. In light of the recently proposed paradigm that an IL-10/IL-12 immunoregulatory circuit controls susceptibility to autoimmune disease, we examined the effect of IFN-beta on the development and behavior of the autoreactive T cell repertoire during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model sharing many features with MS. SWXJ mice were immunized with the immunodominant p139-151 determinant of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), and at onset of EAE were treated every other day with IFN-beta. After eight weeks of treatment, we assessed autoreactivity and observed no significant IFN-beta effect on splenocyte proliferation or splenocyte production of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, or IL-5 in response to the priming determinant used to initiate disease. However, in IFN-beta treated mice, the cytokine profile in response to the priming immunogen was significantly skewed toward an increased production of IL-10 and a concurrent decreased production of IL-12. Moreover, the in vivo modulation of the IL-10/IL-12 immunoregulatory circuit in response to the priming immunogen was accompanied by an aborted development of epitope spreading. Our results indicate that IFN-beta induces a reciprocal modulation of the IL-10/IL-12 cytokine circuit in vivo.

In the present study, we demonstrate similar therapeutic effects after treating (SWR X SJL)F1 mice with IFNbeta at the onset of clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a disease animal model widely used in MS studies. EAE was actively induced by immunization of (SWR X SJL)F1 mice with the immunodominant encephalitogenic peptide 139-151 of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP). In blinded testing, mice treated with IFNbeta at EAE onset showed a delay in progression to clinical disability as determined by marked improvement with time in mean clinical score, significant delay in onset of relapse, and significant decrease in exacerbation frequency compared to placebo-treated control mice. The therapeutic effect of IFNbeta was accompanied by a significant inhibition of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) but not proliferation in response to the priming PLP 139-151. In addition, IFNbeta treatment resulted in an overall decrease in severity of both inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system. These results mimic in an autoimmune animal model the effectiveness of IFNbeta treatment observed in MS.

A significant improvement in the degree of recovery following the acute episode and following relapses of EAE was observed in those mice randomized to CTLA-4-Fc treatment. Full clinical remission occurred twice as often in the CTLA-4-Fc group as in those mice receiving placebo, whereas placebo-treated mice were more likely to develop a stable prolonged neurologic deficit. Serial clinical scoring revealed no effect of CTLA-4-Fc upon relapse rate, with greater than 80% of the mice in each group displaying at least one clinical EAE relapse. In that the activation of memory T cells is relatively independent of T cell co-stimulation, these results indicate that development of chronic disease is associated with the activation of naive T cells and the recruitment of the latter cells into the disease process. Blocking B7 molecules may be beneficial in the treatment of established CNS inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.","no",NA,"IEB",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","SJL","female",NA,"Abatacept","control",1,NA,"2",0.5,16,NA,2,16,NA,"mean",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"drug was not called ""abatacept"" in the publication, therefore i wrote ""CTLA-4-Fc"" as the drug name in the extraction",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Failed",NA,"low","unclear","low","unclear","low","low","low","unclear","unclear","high",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","2","not reported","0","mice","4","guinea pig","1","female","not reported","behaviour","not reported","not reported","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,NA,"11","24","35","38","63","35 - 63","1 - 285"

Established therapies target primarily the inflammatory component of the disease, but fail to prevent neurodegeneration. Fingolimod (codenamed FTY720) is an oral sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator with promising results in phase II trials in multiple sclerosis patients and is under further development as a novel treatment for multiple sclerosis. To evaluate whether FTY720 has neuroprotective properties, we tested this drug in a rat model of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced optic neuritis. FTY720 exerted significant anti-inflammatory effects during optic neuritis and reduced inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage; however, FTY720 treatment did not prevent apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the neurons that form the axons of the optic nerve. Consistent with this lack of effect on RGC survival, FTY720 treatment did not improve visual function, nor did it prevent apoptosis of RGCs in vitro. We observed a persistent activation of apoptotic signaling pathways in RGCs under FTY720 treatment, a possible underlying mechanism for the lack of neuroprotection in the presence of strong anti-inflammatory effects, Furthermore, FTY720 shifted the remaining inflammation in the optic nerve toward neurotoxicity by modest up-regulation of potential neurotoxic cytokines. We conclude that FTY720-induced anti-inflammation and axon protection did not of itself protect neurons from apoptotic cell death.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","rat","Brown Norway","female","9","Fingolimod","control",3,20,"1",0,10,0,0.7,10,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"rat","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","29","optic neuritis","3","rats","24","mouse","3","female","histology","behaviour","not reported","not reported","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,"k.hein@uni-goettingen.de","1","1","123","70","673","123 - 673","1 - 1051"

Both vitamin D(3) and 1, 25-dihydroxyviatmin-D(3) (calcitriol) had beneficial effects in EAE/MS. However, the exact cause of vitamin D deficiency in EAE/MS is not clear. Previously, we documented that lovastatin (LOV) provides protection in EAE animals via inhibition of RhoA-ROCK signaling. Herein, we demonstrate that LOV prevents the lowering of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin-D(3) and 1,25-dihydroxyviatmin-D(3) levels including 1,25-dihydroxyviatmin-D(3) levels in the peripheral lymphoid organs and CNS of treated EAE animals. These effects of LOV were attributed to enhanced expression of vitamin D synthesizing enzyme (1<ce><b1>-hydroxylase) in kidney and the CNS, with corresponding reduction of vitamin D catabolizing enzyme (24-hydorxylase) expression in the CNS of EAE animals via inhibition of RhoA-ROCK signaling. Ex vivo and in vitro studies established that autoreactive Th1/Th17 cells had higher expression of 24-hydroxylase than Th2/T regulatory cells, that was reverted by LOV or ROCK inhibitor. Interestingly, LOV-mediated regulation of vitamin D metabolism had improved vitamin D(3) efficacy to confer protection in EAE animals and that was ascribed to the LOV- and calcitriol-induced immunomodulatory synergy. Together, these data provide evidence that interfering with RhoA-ROCK signaling in autoreactive Th1/Th17 cells can improve vitamin D(3) efficacy in clinical trials of MS and related neurodegenerative disorders.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","rat","Lewis","female",NA,"Vitamin D3","control",1,NA,"2",1.2,11,0.2,2.2,11,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"rat","Failed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","143","not reported","0","rats","129","guinea pig","2","female","histology","behaviour","not reported","not reported","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,"singhi@musc.edu","1","1","136","343","838","136 - 838","1 - 1175"

Moreover, therapeutic treatment from day 25 to 45 markedly reversed paralysis in established EAE and normalized the electrophysiological responses, correlating with decreased demyelination in the brain and spinal cord. The effectiveness of FTY720 in this model is likely due to several contributing factors. Evidence thus far supports its role in the reduction of inflammation and preservation of blood-brain-barrier integrity.

Based on the modes of action of interferon-beta (IFN-<ce><b2>) and dimethyl fumarate (DMF), we hypothesized that anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects may synergize in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). METHODS: EAE was induced in C57BL/6 mice by immunization with MOG35-55-peptide. Murine IFN-<ce><b2> was injected s.c. every other day at 10.000IU, and DMF was provided at 15mg/kg by oral gavage twice daily. Control mice received PBS injections and were treated by oral gavage with the vehicle methylcellulose. Mice were scored daily by blinded observers and histological, FACS and cytokine studies were performed to further elucidate the underlying mechanism of action. RESULTS: Combination therapy significantly ameliorated EAE disease course in comparison to controls and monotherapy with IFN-<ce><b2>. Histological analyses showed a significant effect on axon preservation with almost twice as much axons present in inflamed lesions as compared to control. Remarkably, the effect on axonal preservation was more pronounced under combination therapy than with both monotherapies. Neither monotherapy nor combination therapy demonstrated modulation of cytokines and frequency of antigen presenting cells. DISCUSSION: Combination of IFN-<ce><b2> and DMF resulted in greater beneficial effects with improved tissue protection as compared to the respective monotherapies. Further combination studies of these safe therapies in human disease are warranted.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","C57BL/6","female","9","Interferon Beta 1","control",3,NA,"1",2.8,24,0.6,5.5,23,0.4,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dimethyl fumarate",3,"2",3.8,25,0.4,5.5,23,0.4,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed","Marketed","","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","22","not reported","0","mice","21","mouse","3","female","histology","behaviour","not reported","not reported","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","10.1016/j.expneurol.2014.04.003.","gisa.ellrichmann@rub.de","19","20","81","152","37","81 - 380","1 - 482"

Fourteen genes were selectively influenced by Atorvastatin in EAE mice. They are mainly related to immune cell functions and regulation of cell-to-cell interaction.

Differential regulation of the newly detected candidate genes of statin effects COX-1 and HSP-105 and the previously known statin-responsive genes ICAM-1 and CD86 was confirmed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry.

In this study we examined the effects of minocycline on remyelination independent of its effects in limiting immune-mediated white matter damage using a toxin model of demyelination. Demyelinating lesions were induced by injection of ethidium bromide into caudal cerebellar peduncles of adult rats. Minocycline or PBS was administered by twice daily injections from day 1 prior to lesion-induction to post lesion day 3. Remyelination was assessed, blinded to grouping, using standard morphological criteria. The microglia activation within the lesion was assessed by examining the expression of OX-42 and major histocompatibility class II immunoreactivity. The oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) response was quantified by in situ hybridization using probes for OPC-expressed mRNAs, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha and Olig-1. Minocycline treatment strongly inhibited microglia/macrophage activation at day 1 and day 3 post-lesion induction, and suppressed the OPC response to demyelination. We also found a significant decrease in the extent of oligodendrocyte but not Schwann cell remyelination in the minocycline-treated animals as compared with controls at 3 weeks post-lesion induction.

This is owing to the long duration of disease induction and observation of treatment effects in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. We propose a novel adult zebrafish based model which offers a quick and simple protocol that can used to screen candidates as a step between in vitro experiments and rodent studies. The experiments conducted for this manuscript were to standardize a suitable model of EAE in adult zebrafish and validate it using known modulators. METHODS: The EAE model was developed by disease induction with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein - 35-55 (MOG) and observation of survival, clinical signs and body weight changes. We have validated this model using fingolimod. We have further performed detailed validation using dimethyl fumarate, dexamethasone and SR1001, which are known modulators of rodent EAE. RESULTS: The immunization dose for the disease induction was observed to be 0.6mg/ml of MOG in CFA (Complete Freund's adjuvant), injected subcutaneously (s.c.) near spinal vertebrae. In the validation study with fingolimod, we have demonstrated the modulation of disease symptoms, which were also confirmed by histopathological evaluation. Furthermore, detailed validation with three other known drugs showed that our observations concur with those reported in conventional rodent models. DISCUSSION: We have standardized and validated the adult zebrafish EAE model. This model can help get a quick idea of in vivo activity of drugs in a week using very low quantities of candidate compounds.

Available therapies mainly target the inflammatory component of the disease but fail to prevent neurodegeneration. To investigate the effect of minocycline on the survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the neurons that form the axons of the optic nerve, we used a rat model of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Optic neuritis in this model was diagnosed by recording visual evoked potentials and RGC function was monitored by measuring electroretinograms. Functional and histopathological data of RGCs and optic nerves revealed neuronal and axonal protection when minocycline treatment was started on the day of immunization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that minocycline-induced neuroprotection is related to a direct antagonism of multiple mechanisms leading to neuronal cell death such as the induction of anti-apoptotic intracellular signalling pathways and a decrease in glutamate excitotoxicity. From these observations, we conclude that minocycline exerts neuroprotective effects independent of its anti-inflammatory properties.

Enhancing myelin repair by stimulating endogenous progenitors is a main goal in efforts for MS treatment. Fingolimod (FTY720) which is administrated as an oral medicine for relapsing-remitting MS has direct effects on neural cells. In this study, we hypothesized if daily treatment with FTY720 enhances endogenous myelin repair in a model of local demyelination induced by lysolecithin (LPC). We examined the response of inflammatory cells as well as resident OPCs and evaluated the number of newly produced myelinating cells in animals which were under daily treatment with FTY720.

The presumed mode of action is via blockade of axonal voltage gated potassium channels, thereby enhancing conduction in demyelinated axons. In this study, we provide evidence that in addition to those symptomatic effects, 4-AP can prevent neuroaxonal loss in the CNS. Using in vivo optical coherence tomography imaging, visual function testing and histologic assessment, we observed a reduction in retinal neurodegeneration with 4-AP in models of experimental optic neuritis and optic nerve crush. These effects were not related to an anti-inflammatory mode of action or a direct impact on retinal ganglion cells. Rather, histology and in vitro experiments indicated 4-AP stabilization of myelin and oligodendrocyte precursor cells associated with increased nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells. In experimental optic neuritis, 4-AP potentiated the effects of immunomodulatory treatment with fingolimod. As extended release 4-AP is already licensed for symptomatic multiple sclerosis treatment, we performed a retrospective, multicentre optical coherence tomography study to longitudinally compare retinal neurodegeneration between 52 patients on continuous 4-AP therapy and 51 matched controls. In line with the experimental data, during concurrent 4-AP therapy, degeneration of the macular retinal nerve fibre layer was reduced over 2 years. These results indicate disease-modifying effects of 4-AP beyond symptomatic therapy and provide support for the design of a prospective clinical study using visual function and retinal structure as outcome parameters.","no",NA,"IEB",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","C57BL/6","female",NA,"Fampridine","control",1,NA,"0,1,2",1.4,12,0.3,3.2,12,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Fingolimod",1,"0",0.4,12,0.25,2.2,12,0.35,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed","Marketed","","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","36","optic neuritis","5","mice","38","mouse","11","female and male","histology","behaviour","not reported","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","No manual check required","yes",NA,"c(""journals.permissions@oup.com"", ""phil.albrecht@gmail.com"")","1","67","67","368","628","67 - 628","1 - 1157"

Disease-modifying agents slow down the progression of multiple sclerosis and prevent relapses, yet it remains unclear if they yield analgesia. We explored the analgesic potential of fingolimod (FTY720), an agonist and/or functional antagonist at the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), because it reduces hyperalgesia in models of peripheral inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We used a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35 to 55 (MOG35-55) mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, modified to avoid frank paralysis, and thus, allow for assessment of withdrawal behaviors to somatosensory stimuli. Daily intraperitoneal fingolimod reduced behavioral signs of central neuropathic pain (mechanical and cold hypersensitivity) in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. Both autoimmune encephalomyelitis and fingolimod changed hyperalgesia before modifying motor function, suggesting that pain-related effects and clinical neurological deficits were modulated independently. Fingolimod also reduced cellular markers of central sensitization of neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord: glutamate-evoked Ca signaling and stimulus-evoked phospho-extracellular signal-related kinase ERK (pERK) expression, as well as upregulation of astrocytes (GFAP) and macrophage/microglia (Iba1) immunoreactivity. The antihyperalgesic effects of fingolimod were prevented or reversed by the S1PR1 antagonist W146 (1 mg/kg daily, i.p.) and could be mimicked by either repeated or single injection of the S1PR1-selective agonist SEW2871.

Blocking LINGO-1 function leads to robust remyelination. The anti-LINGO-1 Li81 antibody is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for multiple sclerosis (MS) and is the first MS therapy that directly targets myelin repair. LINGO-1 is selectively expressed in brain and spinal cord but not in peripheral tissues. Perhaps the greatest concern for Li81 therapy is the limited access of the drug to the CNS. Here, we measured Li81 concentrations in brain, spinal cord, and cerebral spinal fluid in rats after systemic administration and correlated them with dose-efficacy responses in rat lysolecithin and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis spinal cord models of remyelination. Remyelination was dose-dependent, and levels of Li81 in spinal cord that promoted myelination correlated well with affinity measurements for the binding of Li81 to LINGO-1. Observed Li81 concentrations in the CNS of 0.1 to 0.4% of blood levels are consistent with values reported for other antibodies. To understand the features of the antibody that affect CNS penetration, we also evaluated the pharmacokinetics of Li81 Fab2, Fab, and poly(ethylene glycol)-modified Fab. The reagents all showed similar CNS exposure despite large differences in their sizes, serum half-lives, and volumes of distribution, and area under the curve (AUC) measurements in the CNS directly correlated with AUC measurements in serum. These studies demonstrate that exposure levels achieved by passive diffusion of the Li81 monoclonal antibody into the CNS are sufficient and lead to robust remyelination.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","rat","Brown Norway","female",NA,"Opicinumab","control",1,NA,"2",1.3,10,0.2,2,10,0.3,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"age=adult",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"rat","Failed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","19","lysolecithin","2","rats","39","hamster","1","female and male","histology","behaviour","not reported","not reported","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,NA,"12","28","93","315","871","93 - 871","1 - 1116"

This study investigated neurophysiological deficits in descending spinal cord motor tracts during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a model of multiple sclerosis) and the functional effectiveness of prophylactic or therapeutic teriflunomide treatment in preventing the debilitating paralysis observed in this model. Relapsing-remitting EAE was induced in Dark Agouti rats using rat spinal cord homogenate. Animals were treated with oral teriflunomide (10 mg/kg daily) prophylactically, therapeutically, or with vehicle (control). Transcranial magnetic motor-evoked potentials were measured throughout the disease to provide quantitative assessment of the neurophysiological status of descending motor tracts. Axonal damage was quantified histologically by silver staining. Both prophylactic and therapeutic teriflunomide treatment significantly reduced maximum EAE disease scores (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0001, respectively) compared with vehicle-treated rats. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that both teriflunomide treatment regimens prevented a delay in wave-form latency and a decrease in wave-form amplitude compared with that observed in vehicle-treated animals. A significant reduction in axonal loss was observed with both teriflunomide treatment regimens compared with vehicle (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0014, respectively). The results of this study suggest that therapeutic teriflunomide can prevent the deficits observed in this animal model in descending spinal cord motor tracts. The mechanism behind reduced axonal loss and improved motor function may be primarily the reduced inflammation and consequent demyelination observed in these animals through the known effects of teriflunomide on impairing proliferation of stimulated T cells.

Previously, a fusion protein consisting of human CTLA-4 linked to human Fc was shown to bind B7-1 and B7-2 with high avidity and to prevent specific T cell activation. Here we investigated the effects of a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human CTLA-4 bound to mouse IgG2a Fc (CTLA-4-Fc) upon experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a T cell-mediated disease that serves as a model for multiple sclerosis.

Besides inhibiting development of encephalitogenic T cells, atorvastatin treatment of EAE has been associated with an induction of anti-inflammatory myelin-reactive T-helper type (Th)-2 cells. To investigate the clinical significance of atorvastatin-mediated Th2 differentiation, we first evaluated atorvastatin treatment in interleukin (IL)-4 green fluorescent protein-enhanced transcript (4-GET) reporter mice. Atorvastatin treatment failed to induce IL-4-producing Th2 cells in vivo; however, when T cells from atorvastatin-treated 4-GET mice were reactivated in vitro, T cells preferentially differentiated into Th2 cells, while antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (interferon gamma, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor and IL-12) were reduced. Oral atorvastatin also prevented or reversed EAE in signal transducer and activator of transcription 6-deficient (STAT6-/-) mice, which cannot generate IL-4-producing Th2 cells. Further, atorvastatin treatment did not induce or expand Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in either wild-type or STAT6-/- mice. In vivo proliferation of T cells, as measured by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine, was inhibited in atorvastatin-treated wild-type and STAT6-/- mice. These data imply that atorvastatin ameliorates central nervous system autoimmune disease primarily by inhibiting proliferation of proinflammatory encephalitogenic T cells, and not simply through induction of anti-inflammatory Th2 cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: EAE was induced in 36 female Hartley guinea pigs, and the treatment period was from day 11 to day 17 post-immunization. Animals received either saline (n = 12), anti-alpha4 integrin antibody (AN100226m; n = 12) or CT301 (n = 12). T2-weighted fast spin echo and T1-weighted pre- and post-contrast scans were performed at the beginning (day 11) and end (day 18) of the treatment period, and scored for cerebral inflammation and gadolinium enhancement. T1-weighted images were further analyzed to quantify this enhancement as a measure of blood-brain barrier integrity. Dissected CNS was evaluated for inflammation and demyelination. RESULTS: CT301 successfully reversed two clinical indicators of disease over the course of the treatment period. These animals showed decreased T2-weighted abnormalities, as well as a reduction in gadolinium leakage on T1-weighted images.

METHODS: We collected splenocytes and CD4(+) T cells from C57BL/6 wild-type and interferon (IFN)-<ce><b3>-deficient mice. For human PBMCs, venous blood was collected from healthy donors, and PBMCs were collected using the Percoll gradient method. Cells were cultured with anti-CD3/28 in the presence/absence of DF for 3 to 5 days. Cells were stained and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cytokines were measured by ELISA in cell supernatants. For in vivo experiments, EAE was induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein(35-55) and mice were treated with oral DF or vehicle daily. RESULTS: DF acts directly on CD4(+) T cells and suppresses GM-CSF-producing Th1 not Th17 or single GM-CSF(+) T cells in EAE. In addition, GM-CSF suppression depends on the IFN-<ce><b3> pathway.

One of the suggested modes of action is the potential of FAE to exert a neuroprotective effect. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have investigated the impact of monomethylfumarate (MMF) and dimethylfumaric acid (DMF) on de- and remyelination using the toxic cuprizone model where the blood-brain-barrier remains intact and only scattered T-cells and peripheral macrophages are found in the central nervous system (CNS), thus excluding the influence of immunomodulatory effects on peripheral immune cells. FAE showed marginally accelerated remyelination in the corpus callosum compared to controls. However, we found no differences for demyelination and glial reactions in vivo and no cytoprotective effect on oligodendroglial cells in vitro.

Thus, there is need to develop new therapeutic strategies that not only address immunomodulation but also neuroprotection. Here we show that the combination therapy of Glatiramer acetate (GA), an immunomodulatory MS therapeutic, and the neuroprotectant epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the main phenol in green tea, have synergistic protective effects in vitro and in the EAE model. EGCG and GA together led to increased protection from glutamate- and TRAIL-induced neuronal cell death in vitro. EGCG combined with GA induced regeneration of hippocampal axons in an outgrowth assay. The combined application of EGCG and GA did not result in unexpected adverse events in vivo. Neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects could be translated in the in vivo model, where combination treatment with EGCG and GA significantly delayed disease onset, strongly reduced clinical severity, even after onset of symptoms and reduced inflammatory infiltrates. These results illustrate the promise of combining neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory treatments and strengthen the prospects of EGCG as an adjunct therapy for neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","SJL","female","7","Epigallocatechin gallate","control",1,NA,"0,2",1,8,0.4,2.5,8,0.4,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Glatiramer acetate",1,"0",1.6,8,0.3,2.2,8,0.4,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Failed","Marketed","","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","12","not reported","0","mice","6","mouse","3","female","histology","behaviour","not reported","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","10.1371/journal.pone.0025456.g001","frauke.zipp@unimedizin-mainz.de","9","35","80","75","326","80 - 326","1 - 550"

Further, adoptive transfer of GA-induced CD8(+) T cells resulted in amelioration of EAE, establishing a role as a viable immunotherapy in demyelinating disease.

Here we investigate effects of fingolimod on expression of astroglial glutamate transporters under pro-inflammatory conditions. In astrocyte cell culture, the addition of pro-inflammatory cytokines led to a significant downregulation of glutamate transporters glutamate transporter-1 (slc1a2/SLC1A2) and glutamate aspartate transporter (slc1a3/SLC1A3) expression on the mRNA or protein level. In this setting, the direct application of fingolimod-1 phosphate (F1P) on astrocytes did not change expression levels of slc1a2 and slc1a3 mRNA. The analysis of both transporters on the protein level by Western Blot and immunocytochemistry did also not reveal any effect of F1P. On a functional level, the addition of conditioned supernatants from F1P treated astrocytes to neuronal cell culture did not result in increased neurite growth. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis as a model of multiple sclerosis, fingolimod treatment reduced T cell and macrophages/microglia mediated inflammation and also diminished astrocyte activation. At the same time, fingolimod restored the reduced expression of slc1a2 and slc1a3 in the inflamed spinal cord on the mRNA level and of SLC1A2 and SLC1A3 on the protein level, presumably via indirect, anti-inflammatory mechanisms.

In particular, glutamatergic dysregulation in the cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus (CxBGTh) circuit could be associated with decline in these behaviors. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of an immunomodulatory therapy (teriflunomide, Aubagio<c2><ae>) on changes of the CxBGTh loop in the Theiler's Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus, (TMEV) mouse model of MS. METHODS: Forty-eight (48) mice were infected with TMEV, treated with teriflunomide (24) or control vehicle (24) and followed for 39 weeks. Mice were examined with MRS and volumetric MRI scans (0, 8, 26, and 39 weeks) in the cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus, using a 9.4T scanner, and with behavioral tests (0, 4, 8, 12, 17, 26, and 39 weeks). Within conditions, MRI measures were compared between two time points by paired samples t-test and across multiple time points by repeated measures ANOVA (rmANOVA), and between conditions by independent samples t-test and rmANOVA, respectively. Data were considered as significant at the p<0.01 level and as a trend at p<0.05 level. RESULTS: In the thalamus, the teriflunomide arm exhibited trends toward decreased glutamate levels at 8 and 26 weeks compared to the control arm (p = 0.039 and p = 0.026), while the control arm exhibited a trend toward increased glutamate between 0 to 8 weeks (p = 0.045). In the basal ganglia, the teriflunomide arm exhibited a trend toward decreased glutamate earlier than the control arm, from 0 to 8 weeks (p = 0.011), resulting in decreased glutamate compared to the control arm at 8 weeks (p = 0.016).

In animal models of various inflammatory and degenerative central nervous system disorders, GA-induced T cells cross the blood-brain barrier, secrete high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophins, and thus both reduce neuronal damage and promote neurogenesis. Recently, it has been suggested that GA itself may permeate the (impaired) blood-brain-barrier and directly protect neurons under conditions of inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration. To test this hypothesis, we examined the direct effects of GA on neuronal functionality and T cell-mediated neuronal apoptosis in culture, acute brain slices, and focal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. GA caused a depolarization of the resting membrane potential and led to an immediate impairment of action potential generation in neurons. Moreover, GA-incubated neurons underwent dose-dependent apoptosis. Apoptosis of ovalbumin peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex class I-expressing neurons induced by ovalbumin-specific effector T cells could be reduced by pre-incubation of T cells, but not neurons with GA. Similar results could be found using acute brain slices. In focal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, lesion size and neuronal apoptosis could be limited by pretreating rats with GA, whereas intracerebral GA application into the inflammatory lesion had no effect on neuronal survival.

METHODS: EAE was induced by subcutaneous immunization of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35-55) in 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice. During EAE induction, mice were separated to distinct groups and provided either BIO-1211 (5 and 10<e2><80><89>mg/kg) or NTZ (5<e2><80><89>mg/kg) and co-administration of these two compounds. After 21 days, neuro-inflammatory responses were analyzed using qRT-PCR, western blot, and ELISA methods. Pervade of immune cells to brain was examined by Evans blue staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of specific markers of microglia/monocytes (CD11b) and leukocytes (CD45). RESULTS: Targeted disruption of VLA4/VCAM1 interactions, by BIO-1211 agonist in mice, results in reduced cytokines expression, leukocyte trafficking, and inhibition of inflammatory responses in EAE (p<e2><80><89><<e2><80><89>0.01) in a dose-independent manner (data not shown).

Emotional and cognitive deficits are now recognized as primary disease manifestations and not simply the consequence of living with a chronic condition, raising questions regarding the efficacy of current therapeutics for these specific symptoms. Mechanisms underlying psychiatric sequelae in MS are believed to be similar to those underlying pathogenesis, that is mediated by cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of MS depression, we performed behavioral assays in the murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) MS model, in the presence or absence of immunomodulation using the drug FTY720, an analogue of the lipid signaling molecule sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Specifically, mice were challenged with the elevated plus maze (EPM) test, a validated experimental paradigm for rodent-specific anxiety-like behavior. FTY720 treatment failed to ameliorate anxiety-like symptoms, irrespective of dosage. On the other hand, it was effective in reducing inflammatory infiltration, microglial reactivity and levels of pro-inflammatory molecules in the hippocampus, confirming the anti-inflammatory capacity of treatment. To explore the absence of FTY720 effect on behavior, we confirmed expression of S1P receptors (S1PR) S1PR1, S1PR3 and S1PR5 in the hippocampus and mapped the dynamics of these receptors in response to drug treatment alone, or in combination with EAE induction. We identified a complex pattern of responses, differing between (1) receptors, (2) dosage and (3) hippocampal sub-field. FTY720 treatment in the absence of EAE resulted in overall downregulation of S1PR1 and S1PR3, while S1PR5 exhibited a dose-dependent upregulation.

In this context in fact, a combined therapy of tolDC with an immunomodulatory treatment could potentiate the beneficial effect of this antigen-specific cell therapy. For this purpose, we analyzed the efficacy of a combined therapy based on the use of vitamin D3 (VitD3)-tolDC plus interferon beta (IFN-beta) in MS. VitD3-tolDC were generated from healthy donors and MS patients and co-cultured with allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells, in the presence or absence of IFN-beta. In vitro, VitD3-tolDC treatment reduced the percentage of activated T cells and allogeneic proliferation, whereas VitD3-tolDC+IFN-beta treatment enhanced the suppressive ability of VitD3-tolDC and, additionally, induced a shift towards a Th2 profile. To determine the clinical benefit of the combined therapy, C57BL/6-experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-induced mice were treated with antigen-specific VitD3-tolDC and/or IFN-beta.

Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibits inflammation-driven acute and chronic phases, spinal cord lesions, brain and spinal cord atrophy, and white matter injury. The objective of the study was to investigate whether Sp treatment could attenuate inflammation-induced pathology in the TMEV model by inhibiting microglial activation and preventing the atrophy of central nervous tissue associated with neurodegeneration. Clinical disability score (CDS), body weight (BW), and rotarod retention time measures were used to assess Sp's impact on neurodegeneration and disease progression in 4 study groups of 102 animals, including 44 Sp-treated (SpT), 44 vehicle-treated, 6 saline-injected, and 8 age-matched healthy controls (HC). Next, 58 (22 SpT, 22 vehicle, 6 saline injected, and 8 HC) out of the 102 animals were further evaluated to assess the effect of Sp on brain region-specific and spinal cord volume changes, as well as microglial activation. Sp increased CDS and decreased BW and rotarod retention time in TMEV mice, but did not significantly affect most brain region volumes, except for lateral ventricle volume. Sp suppressed ventricular enlargement, suggesting reduced TMEV-induced inflammation in LV. No significant differences in spine volume changes were observed between Sp- and vehicle-treated animals, but there were differences between HC and TMEV groups, indicating TMEV-induced inflammation contributed to increased spine volume. Spine histology revealed no significant microglial density differences between groups in gray matter, but HC animals had higher type 1 morphology and lower type 2 morphology percentages in gray and white matter regions. This suggests that Sp did not significantly affect microglial density but may have modulated neuroinflammation in the spinal cord. Sp may have some effects on neuroinflammation and ventricular enlargement. However, it did not demonstrate a significant impact on neurodegeneration, spinal volume, or lesion volume in the TMEV mouse model. Further investigation is required to fully understand Sp's effect on microglial activation and its relevance to the pathophysiology of MS. The differences between the current study and previous research using other MS models, such as EAE, highlight the differences in pathological processes in these two disease models.","no",NA,"BVI",1,NA,"TMEV-IDD","mouse","SJL",NA,"4.5","Siponimod","control",1,102,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,"2011",NA,"TMEV","22","not reported","0","mice","16","mouse","3","not reported","histology","behaviour","imaging","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","yes","10.3390/ijms241612990/s1.",NA,"16","55","882","88","782","882 - 1058","1 - 1141"

Consistent with this theory, previous research has shown a strong protective effect 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an MS model. However, it is not known whether the hormone precursor, vitamin D(3), has protective effects in EAE. To address this question, B10.PL mice were fed a diet with or without vitamin D(3), immunized with myelin basic protein, and studied for signs of EAE and for metabolites and transcripts of the vitamin D(3) endocrine system. The intact, vitamin D(3)-fed female mice had significantly less clinical, histopathological, and immunological signs of EAE than ovariectomized females or intact or castrated males. Correlating with reduced EAE, the intact, vitamin D(3)-fed female mice had significantly more 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and fewer CYP24A1 transcripts, encoding the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)-inactivating enzyme, in the spinal cord than the other groups of mice. Thus, there was an unexpected synergy between vitamin D(3) and ovarian tissue with regard to EAE inhibition. We hypothesize that an ovarian hormone inhibited CYP24A1 gene expression in the spinal cord, so the locally-produced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) accumulated and resolved the inflammation before severe EAE developed. If humans have a similar gender difference in vitamin D(3) metabolism in the CNS, then sunlight deprivation would increase the MS risk more significantly in women than in men, which may contribute to the unexplained higher MS incidence in women than in men.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","B10.PL","both","8","Vitamin D3","control",1,NA,"0",1.05,53,NA,1.65,53,NA,"mean",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Failed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","33","not reported","0","mice","47","mouse","6","female and male","histology","behaviour","not reported","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,"hayes@biochem.wisc.edu","1","1","90","200","381","90 - 381","1 - 850"

Because MS prevalence and severity decrease sharply with increasing sunlight exposure, and sunlight supports vitamin D(3) synthesis, we proposed that vitamin D(3) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)) may protect against MS. In support of this hypothesis, 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) strongly inhibited experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). This inhibition required lymphocytes other than the encephalitogenic T cells. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) might inhibit EAE through the action of IL-10-producing regulatory lymphocytes. We report that vitamin D(3) and 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) strongly inhibited myelin oligodendrocyte peptide (MOG(35-55))-induced EAE in C57BL/6 mice, but completely failed to inhibit EAE in mice with a disrupted IL-10 or IL-10R gene. Thus, a functional IL-10-IL-10R pathway was essential for 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) to inhibit EAE. The 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) also failed to inhibit EAE in reciprocal, mixed bone marrow chimeras constructed by transferring IL-10-deficient bone marrow into irradiated wild-type mice and vice versa. Thus, 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) may be enhancing an anti-inflammatory loop involving hemopoietic cell-produced IL-10 acting on brain parenchymal cells and vice versa. If this interpretation is correct, and humans have a similar bidirectional IL-10-dependent loop, then an IL-10-IL-10R pathway defect could abrogate the anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective functions of sunlight and vitamin D(3). In this way, a genetic IL-10-IL-10R pathway defect could interact with an environmental risk factor, vitamin D(3) insufficiency, to increase MS risk and severity.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","C57BL/6","both","7","Vitamin D3","control",1,NA,"0,2",0.5,22,NA,2.8,22,NA,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Failed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","66","not reported","0","mice","84","mouse","11","female and male","histology","behaviour","not reported","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,"hayes@biochem.wisc.edu","1","1","69","188","467","69 - 467","1 - 753"

While inflammation is present at all stages of MS, it is more pronounced in the relapsing forms of the disease, whereas progressive MS (PMS) shows significant neuroaxonal damage and grey and white matter atrophy. Hence, disease-modifying treatments beneficial in patients with relapsing MS have limited success in PMS. BAF312 (siponimod) is a novel sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator shown to delay progression in PMS. Besides reducing inflammation by sequestering lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues, BAF312 crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds its receptors on neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. To evaluate potential direct neuroprotective effects, BAF312 was systemically or locally administered in the CNS of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice with distinct grey- and white-matter lesions (focal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis using an osmotic mini-pump). Ex-vivo flow cytometry revealed that systemic but not local BAF312 administration lowered immune cell infiltration in animals with both grey and white matter lesions. Ex-vivo voltage-sensitive dye imaging of acute brain slices revealed an altered spatio-temporal pattern of activation in the lesioned cortex compared to controls in response to electrical stimulation of incoming white-matter fiber tracts. Here, BAF312 administration showed partial restore of cortical neuronal circuit function.

To investigate how 1,25-(OH)2D3 could carry out anti-inflammatory functions, we administered 1,25-(OH)2D3 or a placebo to mice with EAE, and subsequently analyzed clinical disease, chemokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and recruitment of dye-labeled monocytes. The 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment significantly reduced clinical EAE severity within 3 days. Sharp declines in chemokines, inducible iNOS, and CD11b+ monocyte recruitment into the central nervous system (CNS) preceded this clinical disease abatement in the 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated animals. The 1,25-(OH)2D3 did not directly and rapidly inhibit chemokine synthesis in vivo or in vitro. Rather, the 1,25-(OH)2D3 rapidly stimulated activated CD4+ T cell apoptosis in the CNS and spleen. Collectively, these results support a model wherein inflammation stimulates a natural anti-inflammatory feedback loop. The activated inflammatory cells produce 1,25-(OH)2D3, and this hormone subsequently enhances the apoptotic death of inflammatory CD4+ T cells, removing the driving force for continued inflammation. In this way, the sunlight-derived hormone could reduce the risk of chronic CNS inflammation and autoimmune-mediated neurodegenerative disease.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","B10.PL",NA,NA,"Vitamin D3","control",1,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Failed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","68","not reported","0","mice","50","rat","3","male","histology","behaviour","not reported","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","10.1002/jnr","hayes@biochem.wisc.edu","1","1","104","36","601","104 - 601","1 - 889"

The underlying multifactorial anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective effect of GA is in the induction of reactive T cells that release immunomodulatory cytokines and neurotrophic factors at the injury site. These GA-induced cytokines and growth factors may have a direct effect on axon function. Building on previous findings that suggest a neuroprotective effect of GA, we assessed the therapeutic effects of GA on brain and spinal cord pathology and functional correlates using the chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. Therapeutic regimens were utilized based on promising prophylactic efficacy. More specifically, C57BL/6 mice were treated with 2 mg/mouse/day GA for 8 days beginning at various time points after EAE post-induction day 15, yielding a thorough, clinically relevant assessment of GA efficacy within the context of severe progressive disease. Therapeutic treatment with GA significantly decreased clinical scores and improved rotorod motor performance in EAE mice. These functional improvements were supported by an increase in myelinated axons and fewer amyloid precursor protein-positive axons in the spinal cords of GA-treated EAE mice. Furthermore, therapeutic GA decreased microglia/macrophage and T cell infiltrates and increased oligodendrocyte numbers in both the spinal cord and corpus callosum of EAE mice. Finally, GA improved callosal axon conduction and nodal protein organization in EAE. Our results demonstrate that therapeutic GA treatment has significant beneficial effects in a chronic mouse model of MS, in which its positive effects on both myelinated and non-myelinated axons results in improved axon function.","no",NA,"WZ",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","C57BL/6","both","8","Glatiramer acetate","control",1,NA,"2",2,20,0.3,3.6,20,0.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"M und F poolen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","140","not reported","0","mice","72","mouse","10","female and male","histology","behaviour","not reported","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","10.1002/jnr.23440","c(""seemaw@ucla.edu"", ""seema.tiwari-woodruff@ucr.edu"")","1","1","163","40","731","163 - 731","1 - 1168"

To investigate functional changes following demyelination in a well-defined, topographically organized neuronal network, in vitro and in vivo, we focused on the primary auditory cortex (A1) of mice in the cuprizone model of general de- and remyelination. Following myelin loss in this model system, the spatiotemporal propagation of incoming stimuli in A1 was altered and the hierarchical activation of supra- and infragranular cortical layers was lost suggesting a profound effect exerted on neuronal network level. In addition, the response latency in field potential recordings and voltage-sensitive dye imaging was increased following demyelination. These alterations were accompanied by a loss of auditory discrimination abilities in freely behaving animals, a reduction of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf-2) protein in the nucleus in histological staining and persisted during remyelination. To find new strategies to restore demyelination-induced network alteration in addition to the ongoing remyelination, we tested the cytoprotective potential of dimethyl fumarate (DMF). Therapeutic treatment with DMF during remyelination significantly modified spatiotemporal stimulus propagation in the cortex, reduced the cognitive impairment, and prevented the demyelination-induced decrease in nuclear Nrf-2. These results indicate the involvement of anti-oxidative mechanisms in regulating spatiotemporal cortical response pattern following changes in myelination and point to DMF as therapeutic compound for intervention.","no",NA,"IEB",1,NA,"cuprizone","mouse","C57BL/6",NA,"10","Dimethyl fumarate","control",1,NA,"2,3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"cuprizone","38","not reported","0","mice","7","rabbit","3","not reported","histology","behaviour","not reported","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","not reported",NA,"manuela.cerina@ukmuenster.de","12","30","123","90","827","123 - 827","1 - 1410"

Remarkably, rebound is preceded by a burst of S1P1 overexpression in lymph node-entrapped lymphocytes that correlates with subsequent massive lymphocyte egress and widespread CNS immune infiltration.

We thus investigated whether memory impairment encountered at the early stage of the disease could be explained by a differential vulnerability of particular hippocampal subfields. By using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, we identified that early memory impairment was associated with selective alteration of the dentate gyrus as pinpointed in vivo with diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI). Neuromorphometric analyses and electrophysiological recordings confirmed dendritic degeneration, alteration in glutamatergic synaptic transmission and impaired long-term synaptic potentiation selectively in the dentate gyrus, but not in CA1, together with a more severe pattern of microglial activation in this subfield. Systemic injections of the microglial inhibitor minocycline prevented DTI, morphological, electrophysiological and behavioral impairments in EAE-mice. Furthermore, daily infusions of minocycline specifically within the dentate gyrus were sufficient to prevent memory impairment in EAE-mice while infusions of minocycline within CA1 were inefficient. We conclude that early memory impairment in EAE is due to a selective disruption of the dentate gyrus associated with microglia activation.

The prevailing view is TRMs are protective against pathogens in the brain. However, the extent to which antigen-specific TRMs induce neuropathology upon reactivation is understudied. Using the described phenotype of TRMs, we found that brains of naïve mice harbor populations of CD69+ CD103- T cells. Notably, numbers of CD69+ CD103- TRMs rapidly increase following neurological insults of various origins. This TRM expansion precedes infiltration of virus antigen-specific CD8 T cells and is due to proliferation of T cells within the brain. We next evaluated the capacity of antigen-specific TRMs in the brain to induce significant neuroinflammation post virus clearance, including infiltration of inflammatory myeloid cells, activation of T cells in the brain, microglial activation, and significant blood brain barrier disruption. These neuroinflammatory events were induced by TRMs, as depletion of peripheral T cells or blocking T cell trafficking using FTY720 did not change the neuroinflammatory course. Depletion of all CD8 T cells, however, completely abrogated the neuroinflammatory response. Reactivation of antigen-specific TRMs in the brain also induced profound lymphopenia within the blood compartment. We have therefore determined that antigen-specific TRMs can induce significant neuroinflammation, neuropathology, and peripheral immunosuppression. The use of cognate antigen to reactivate CD8 TRMs enables us to isolate the neuropathologic effects induced by this cell type independently of other branches of immunological memory, differentiating this work from studies employing whole pathogen re-challenge. This study also demonstrates the capacity for CD8 TRMs to contribute to pathology associated with neurodegenerative disorders and long-term complications associated with viral infections. Understanding functions of brain TRMs is crucial in investigating their role in neurodegenerative disorders including MS, CNS cancers, and long-term complications associated with viral infections including COVID-19.","no",NA,"BVI",1,NA,"TMEV-IDD","mouse","C57BL/6","both",NA,"Fingolimod","control",0,170,"0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,"2011",NA,"TMEV","110","not reported","0","mice","132","mouse","9","female and male","histology","behaviour","imaging","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","yes",NA,"Johnson.aaron2@mayo.edu","23","38","165","162","1126","165 - 1126","1 - 1868"

Neither prophylactic nor therapeutic treatment with 4-AP altered disease incidence or disease course of EAE. Histopathological signs of demyelination and neuronal damage as well as MRI imaging of brain volume changes were unaltered. While application of 4-AP significantly reduced the standing outward current of stimulated CD4(+) T cells compared to controls, it failed to impact intracellular calcium concentrations in these cells. Compatibly, KV channel inhibition neither influenced CD4(+) T cell effector functions (proliferation, IL17 or IFN<ce><b3> production).

They both suggest that a vitamin D deficiency during these critical imprinting periods is a risk factor for MS. After having confirmed that people born in November are at lower risk of developing MS, we devised a mouse model of prenatal vitamin D deficiency. We observed that adult offspring born to vitamin D deficient mothers, when compared to control offspring, developed a striking milder and delayed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and permanently overexpressed the vitamin D receptor. This unexpected finding led us to conjecture that the newborns, after having known an in utero vitamin D-deficient environment, were highly sensitive ex utero to cholecalciferol-containing diet and interpreted the postnatal food as a vitamin D enriched environment. To validate this hypothesis, we devised a mouse model of postnatal vitamin D supplementation. Interestingly, using the same EAE model, we demonstrated that a delayed onset and less severe symptoms were displayed by postnatally vitamin D-supplemented mice. The latter finding is in accordance with previous animal studies demonstrating that a postnatal vitamin D deficiency induced an earlier onset and an increased symptom severity of EAE and epidemiological reports describing the importance of an adequate supply of vitamin D during early life.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","mouse",NA,"female","12","Vitamin D3","control",3,47,"0,3",1,7,NA,2.5,6,NA,"mean",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"prenatal administration of Vitamin D3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Failed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","10","experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","1","mice","7","rat","1","female","not reported","behaviour","not reported","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","10.1016/j.jns.2011.08.044","francois.feron@univmed.fr","9","29","33","34","216","33 - 216","1 - 461"

OBJECTIVE: We examined whether an antibody against IL-12/23, ustekinumab (UTZ) (Stelera<c2><ae>), used clinically in psoriasis would have similar anti-inflammatory effects in EAE after oral administration. DESIGN/METHODS: B6 mice were immunized with MOG peptide 35-55 and gavaged with isotype IgG control or UTZ during ongoing disease. Splenocytes, CD4(+) T cells or macrophages/monocyte lineage cells (CD11b(+)) from control fed or UTZ fed mice were adoptively transferred into active MOG peptide 35-55 immunized recipient mice during ongoing disease. Actively fed and recipient mice were examined for disease inhibition, inflammation, and cytokine responses. RESULTS: Ingested (oral) UTZ inhibited ongoing disease and decreased inflammation. Adoptively transferred cells from UTZ fed donors protected against actively induced disease and decreased inflammation. Oral UTZ decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines Th1-like cytokines IL-2, IL-12, IFN-<ce><b3>, IL-17 (Teff) and TNF-<ce><b1> in UTZ fed mice and increased counter-regulatory cytokines IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 in recipients of donor cells from UTZ fed mice.

Minocycline is effective in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and is a promising candidate for future MS medication. Glucocorticosteroids (GCS) belong to the most potent immunosuppressive drugs and are the mainstay for treatment of acute relapses in MS. In this study, we tested whether the combination of minocycline and prednisone (a synthetic GCS) at suboptimal doses could produce synergistic effects in EAE. Our findings showed that the combination of these two drugs functioned better than when they were individually administered in EAE mice, as evidenced by decreased clinical scores, reduced inflammation and demyelination, and improved magnetic resonance imaging outcomes. Further studies revealed that the combined treatment prevented the reduction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA expression in cerebral cortex of EAE mice.

Currently approved treatments have several shortcomings. Consequently, new and effective treatments with improved safety and convenience profiles are sought after by patients. OBJECTIVE: To explore the overall profile of vidofludimus for the treatment of RRMS. METHODS: Preclinical investigations were done exploring the species-dependency of DHODH inhibition of vidofludimus. In addition, the preclinical efficacy in a rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model and the inhibition of cytokine release from activated PBMC were investigated. Pharmacokinetic data were also obtained in a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose trial of the formulation IMU-838 (vidofludimus calcium). RESULTS: It was shown that vidofludimus is 2.6 times more potent in inhibiting DHO oxidation by human DHODH compared to teriflunomide. Although both compounds increased cell apoptosis, vidofludimus was more efficacious in the inhibition of T-lymphocyte proliferation compared to teriflunomide. The same was also observed for the secretion of IL-17 and IFN-<ce><b3>. Interestingly, the potency or vidofludimus to inhibit rat or mouse DHODH is 7.5 and 64.4 time lower than the for the human DHODH, respectively. The rat EAE study clearly exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of cumulative disease scores by vidofludimus. In the multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial, the serum half-life of about 30<c2><a0>h provides a favorable profile for once daily dosing of IMU-838, with quick dosing to steady state through levels within 5 days and the ability to wash out drug quickly, if required. CONCLUSIONS: The investigations highlighted that the desired selective immunomodulatory properties can be separated from general antiproliferative effects seen and related adverse events in first-generation DHODH inhibitors. Based on data obtained from a series of pre-clinical as well as phase 1 and phase 2 studies, IMU-838 is a promising next-generation candidate for the oral treatment of RRMS.

The lipophilicity and low molecular weight of FTY720 allows it to cross blood brain barrier (BBB) and exert both peripheral and central effects. Previous reports showed that intranasal (IN) administration of drugs are the preferred non-invasive route, which bypasses BBB and improves their delivery and bioavailability in the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, we aimed to compare the effects of IN and oral administrations of FTY720 on astrocyte activation and demyelination levels of optic chiasm in a focal demyelination model. METHODS: The experimental model was induced by injection of 2 <c2><b5>L lysolecithin 1% into the optic chiasm of male Wistar rats. The rats were treated by oral gavage or intranasal drop of FTY720 at dose of 0.3<c2><a0>mg/kg for 14 days. Astrocyte activation was analyzed using GFAP immunostaining, extent of demyelination, and myelination levels were measured by fluoromyelin staining, and MOG immunostaining, respectively. Then, the concentration of FTY720 was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method in brain tissues. RESULTS: Our data showed that IN administration of FTY720 significantly decreases astrocyte activation and demyelination levels in the optic chiasm compared to the oral administration route. In addition, the concentration of FTY720 was higher in the brain tissue of IN receiving rats compared to the oral treated group. CONCLUSION: It seems that IN administration of FTY720 may be a preferred route to decline the central inflammation and demyelination levels in the MS patients.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"lysolecithin","rat","Wistar","male",NA,"Fingolimod","control",1,30,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"rat","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"lysolecithin","5","not reported","0","rats","16","rabbit","3","male","histology","not reported","not reported","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,"srostami.m@gmail.com","22","43","101","38","293","101 - 293","1 - 540"

Cyclotides are small plant proteins with a wide range of biological activity, making them a target for researchers to investigate. This study was conducted to investigate the possible effects of cyclotide-rich fractions from Viola odorata as an immunomodulatory agent in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. METHODS: At room temperature, the plant materials were subjected to maceration in methanol: dichloromethane (1:1; v/v) for 3 days. The extraction was repeated 3 times, and the final concentrated extract was partitioned 3 times by 1/2 volume of double-distilled water. The aqueous phases were separated and freeze-dried. Finally, the crude extract was fractionated by C18 silicagel using vacuum liquid chromatography, with mobile phases of 30%, 50% and 80% of ethanol: water, respectively. The 50%, and 80% fractions were analyzed by HPLC and MALDI-TOF analysis and administrated intraperitoneally to forty-five female C57BL/6 EAE-induced mice, at 5, 25, and 50 mg/kg doses. After 28 days, the animals were evaluated using EAE clinical scoring which was done every 3 days, cytokine levels, and myelination level. RESULTS: The results confirmed the presence of cyclotides in V. odorata based on their retention time and the composition of mobile phase in HPLC and the molecular weight of the peaks in MALDI-TOF analysis. It was observed that cyclotides, especially in the 80% fraction group at the dose of 50 mg/kg significantly reduced the clinical scores, inflammation, and demyelination in EAE mice compared with the normal saline group (P<0.05), and the results of this group were comparable with fingolimod (P>0.05).

Alterations in the TJ proteins are common in inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) like multiple sclerosis (MS). Modulation of the BBB could thus represent a therapeutic mechanism. One pathway to modulate BBB integrity could be the induction of nuclear-factor (erythroid derived 2) related factor-2 (Nrf2) mediated oxidative stress responses which are targeted by fumaric acid esters (FAE). Here we analyze effects of FAE on the expression of TJ proteins in the human cerebral endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We show that dimethylfumarate (DMF) and its primary metabolite monomethylfumarate (MMF) induce the expression of the Nrf2/NQO1 pathway in endothelial cells. Neither MMF nor DMF had a consistent modulatory effect on the expression of TJ molecules in hCMEC/D3 cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF<ce><b1>)-induced downregulation of TJ proteins was at least partially reversed by treatment with FAE. However, DMF had no effect on claudin-5 expression in EAE, despite its effect on the clinical score and infiltration of immune cells.

We herein investigate the therapeutic effect of olean-12-en-28-ol, 3β-pentacosanoate (OPCA) on a preclinical model of MS. First, OPCA was synthesized semisynthetically and characterized. Then, the mice with MOG35-55-induced experimental autoimmune/allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) were given OPCA along with a reference drug (FTY720). Biochemical, cellular, and molecular analyses were performed in serum and brain tissues to measure anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective responses. OPCA treatment protected EAE-induced changes in mouse brains maintaining blood-brain barrier integrity and preventing inflammation. Moreover, the protein and mRNA levels of MS-related genes such as HLD-DR1, CCL5, TNF-α, IL6, and TGFB1 were significantly reduced in OPCA-treated mouse brains. Notably, the expression of genes, including PLP, MBP, and MAG, involved in the development and structure of myelin was significantly elevated in OPCA-treated EAE. Furthermore, therapeutic OPCA effects included a substantial reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum of treated EAE animals. Lastly, following OPCA treatment, the promoter regions for most inflammatory regulators were hypermethylated. These data support that OPCA is a valuable and appealing candidate for human MS treatment since OPCA not only normalizes the pro- and anti-inflammatory immunological bias but also stimulates remyelination in EAE.","no",NA,"BVI",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","C57BL/6","female","7","Fingolimod","control",1,56,"2",1.9,8,0.2,3.5,6,0.7,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,"2011",NA,"EAE","60","not reported","0","mice","51","mouse","12","female","histology","behaviour","not reported","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","10.1021/acs.jnatprod.2c00798","sena@agu.edu.tr","14","1","91","86","86","91 - 1068","1 - 1258"

Here we show that amelioration of MS by dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a mechanistically elusive drug, associates with suppression of Tc17 cells. DMF treatment results in reduced frequency of Tc17, contrary to Th17 cells, and in a decreased ratio of the regulators RORC-to-TBX21, along with a shift towards cytotoxic T lymphocyte gene expression signature in CD8(+) T cells from MS patients. Mechanistically, DMF potentiates the PI3K-AKT-FOXO1-T-BET pathway, thereby limiting IL-17 and ROR<ce><b3>t expression as well as STAT5-signaling in a glutathione-dependent manner. This results in chromatin remodeling at the Il17 locus. Consequently, T-BET-deficiency in mice or inhibition of PI3K-AKT, STAT5 or reactive oxygen species prevents DMF-mediated Tc17 suppression.

Therefore, non-invasive methods to improve MS lesions detection and monitor therapy response are needed. METHODS: We studied the combined cuprizone and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (CPZ-EAE) mouse model of MS, which presents inflammatory-mediated demyelinated lesions in the central nervous system as commonly seen in MS patients. Using hyperpolarized (13)C MR spectroscopy (MRS) metabolic imaging, we measured cerebral metabolic fluxes in control, CPZ-EAE and CPZ-EAE mice treated with two clinically-relevant therapies, namely fingolimod and dimethyl fumarate. We also acquired conventional T(1) CE MRI to detect active lesions, and performed ex vivo measurements of enzyme activities and immunofluorescence analyses of brain tissue. Last, we evaluated associations between imaging and ex vivo parameters. RESULTS: We show that hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate conversion to lactate is increased in the brain of untreated CPZ-EAE mice when compared to the control, reflecting immune cell activation. We further demonstrate that this metabolic conversion is significantly decreased in response to the two treatments. This reduction can be explained by increased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and a decrease in immune cells. Importantly, we show that hyperpolarized (13)C MRS detects dimethyl fumarate therapy, whereas conventional T(1) CE MRI cannot. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, hyperpolarized MRS metabolic imaging of [1-(13)C]pyruvate detects immunological responses to disease-modifying therapies in MS. This technique is complementary to conventional MRI and provides unique information on neuroinflammation and its modulation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used in the clinic to diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS), which affects the central nervous system and leads to a range of disabling symptoms. However, MRI is often not capable of detecting how well a patient responds to therapies, in particular those targeting the immune system. We questioned whether an advanced MRI method called hyperpolarized (13)C MRS could help. Using a mouse model for MS, we showed that hyperpolarized (13)C MRS can detect response to two therapies used in the clinic, namely fingolimod and dimethyl fumarate when conventional MRI could not. We also showed that this method is sensitive to the immune response. As hyperpolarized (13)C MRS is becoming available in many centers worldwide, it could be used to evaluate existing and new treatments for people living with MS, improving care and quality of life. eng","no",NA,"BVI",1,NA,"Cup/EAE","mouse","C57BL/6","female","8","Fingolimod","control",1,51,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.5,8,0.5,6.3,8,1.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,"Dimethyl fumarate",1,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4.1,8,0.6,6.3,8,1.2,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Marketed","Marketed","","","","","","","","","","",NA,"2011",NA,"EAE","94","experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","5","mice","61","mouse","9","female","histology","behaviour","imaging","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","yes","10.1038/s43856-023-00300-1","c(""caroline.guglielmetti@ucsf.edu"", ""myriam.chaumeil@ucsf.edu"")","9","1","52","306","429","52 - 429","1 - 852"

Indeed, S1PR modulation by FTY720 in murine and human astrocytes suppressed neurodegeneration-promoting mechanisms mediated by astrocytes, microglia, and CNS-infiltrating proinflammatory monocytes.

This causes an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels accompanied by an enhanced mitochondrial stress response, ultimately leading to impaired mitochondrial function. Enhanced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels not only result in enhanced T-cell apoptosis in vitro as well as in dimethyl fumarate-treated patients, but are key for the well-known immunomodulatory effects of dimethyl fumarate both in vitro and in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, i.e. experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Indeed, dimethyl fumarate immune-modulatory effects on T cells were completely abrogated by pharmacological interference of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production.

Application of dimethylfumarate led to stabilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2, activation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2-dependent transcriptional activity and accumulation of NADP(H) quinoline oxidoreductase-1 as a prototypical target gene. Furthermore, the immediate metabolite of dimethylfumarate, monomethylfumarate, leads to direct modification of the inhibitor of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, at cysteine residue 151. In turn, increased levels of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 and reduced protein nitrosylation were detected in the central nervous sytem of dimethylfumarate-treated mice. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 was also upregulated in the spinal cord of autopsy specimens from untreated patients with multiple sclerosis. In dimethylfumarate-treated mice suffering from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, increased immunoreactivity for nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 was detected by confocal microscopy in neurons of the motor cortex and the brainstem as well as in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. In mice deficient for nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 on the same genetic background, the dimethylfumarate mediated beneficial effects on clinical course, axon preservation and astrocyte activation were almost completely abolished thus proving the functional relevance of this transcription factor for the neuroprotective mechanism of action. We conclude that the ability of dimethylfumarate to activate nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 may offer a novel cytoprotective modality that further augments the natural antioxidant responses in multiple sclerosis tissue and is not yet targeted by other multiple sclerosis therapies.","no",NA,"WZ",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","C57BL/6","female","10","Dimethyl fumarate","control",1,NA,"1",2.6,7,0.1,4,7,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","23","experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","1","mice","40","rats","9","female and male","histology","behaviour","imaging","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,"c(""ralf.gold@rub.de"", ""ralf.linker@rub.de"", ""journals.permissions@oup.com"")","1","62","82","69","653","82 - 653","1 - 944"

In the periphery, S1PR modulators prevent lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes, hence hampering neuroinflammation. Recent findings suggest a role for S1PR modulation in remyelination. As the Giα-coupled S1P1 subtype is the most prominently expressed S1PR in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), selective modulation (functional antagonism) of S1P1 may have direct effects on OPC functionality. We hypothesized that functional antagonism of S1P1 by ponesimod induces remyelination by boosting OPC differentiation. In the cuprizone mouse model of demyelination, we found ponesimod to decrease the latency time of visual evoked potentials compared to vehicle conditions, which is indicative of functional remyelination. In addition, the Y maze spontaneous alternations test revealed that ponesimod reversed cuprizone-induced working memory deficits. Myelin basic protein (MBP) immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy of the corpus callosum revealed an increase in myelination upon ponesimod treatment. Moreover, treatment with ponesimod alone or in combination with A971432, an S1P5 monoselective modulator, significantly increased primary mouse OPC differentiation based on O4 immunocytochemistry.

However, levels of astrocytosis and microglia activation dropped below those of the placebo group during the remyelination phase. There was a significant increase in myelination in the calcitriol group throughout the remyelination phase (p = 0.041), while the remyelination in the placebo group was not significant (p = 0.317). After 3 weeks of remyelination, the calcitriol group had more myelin than the placebo group (p = 0.001). The calcitriol group had a higher density of NOGO-A positive cells throughout the remyelination phase, and the number of NOGO-A positive cells was significantly higher in the calcitriol group at one week of remyelination (p = 0.019). There were no significant differences in extent of T-lymphocyte infiltration. High-dose calcitriol seems to be safe regarding remyelination. Our results indicate that this treatment could actually promote the repair process, possibly through a stimulating effect on oligodendrocyte maturation and astrocyte activation.

Here, we variously assessed the effects of an azide analogue of (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate (compound 5; a sphingosine kinase 1 activator), (R)-FTY720 methyl ether (ROMe, a sphingosine kinase 2 inhibitor) and RB-020 (a sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitor and sphingosine kinase 2 substrate) on IL-1<ce><b2> formation, sphingosine 1-phosphate levels and expression of S1P(1) receptors.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We measured IL-1<ce><b2> formation by macrophages, sphingosine 1-phosphate levels and expression levels of S1P(1) receptors in vitro and clinical score in mice with EAE and the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration into the spinal cord in vivo. KEY RESULTS: Treatment of differentiated U937 macrophages with compound 5, RB-020 or sphingosine (but not ROMe) enhanced IL-1<ce><b2> release.

To further investigate its mode of action, we analyzed gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS) during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). FTY720 downregulated inflammatory genes in addition to vascular adhesion molecules. It decreased the matrix metalloproteinase gene MMP-9 and increased its counterregulator--tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, TIMP-1--resulting in a proteolytic balance that favors preservation of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity. Furthermore, FTY720 reduced S1P lyase that increases the S1P concentration in the brain, in line with a marked reversal of neurological deficits and raising the possibility for enhanced triggering of S1P receptors on resident brain cells. This is accompanied by an increase in S1P(1) and S1P(5) in contrast with the attenuation of S1P(3) and S1P(4). Late-stage rescue therapy with FTY720, even up to 1 month after EAE onset, reversed BBB leakiness and reduced demyelination, along with normalization of neurologic function.

Ozanimod profiling revealed a species difference in its potency for S1P(5) in mouse, rat, and canine compared with that for human and monkey. Site-directed mutagenesis identified amino acid alanine at position 120 to be responsible for loss of activity for mouse, rat, and canine S1P(5), and mutation back to threonine as in human/monkey S1P(5) restored activity. Radioligand binding analysis performed with mouse S1P(5) confirmed the potency loss is a consequence of a loss of affinity of ozanimod for mouse S1P(5) and was restored with mutation of alanine 120 to threonine. Study of ozanimod in preclinical mouse models of MS can now determine the S1P receptor(s) responsible for observed efficacies with receptor engagement as measured using pharmacokinetic exposures of free drug. Hence, in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, ozanimod exposures sufficient to engage S1P(1), but not S1P(5), resulted in reduced circulating lymphocytes, disease scores, and body weight loss; reduced inflammation, demyelination, and apoptotic cell counts in the spinal cord; and reduced circulating levels of the neuronal degeneration marker, neurofilament light. In the demyelinating cuprizone model, ozanimod prevented axonal degradation and myelin loss during toxin challenge but did not facilitate enhanced remyelination after intoxication. Since free drug levels in this model only engaged S1P(1,) we concluded that S1P(1) activation is neuroprotective but does not appear to affect remyelination. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Ozanimod, a selective modulator of human sphingisone 1-phosphate receptor subtypes 1 and 5 (S1P(1/5)), displays reduced potency for rodent and dog S1P(5) compared with human, which results from mutation of threonine to alanine at position 120. Ozanimod can thus be used as a selective S1P(1) agonist in mouse models of multiple sclerosis to define efficacies driven by S1P(1) but not S1P(5). Based on readouts for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and cuprizone intoxication, S1P(1) modulation is neuroprotective, but S1P(5) activity may be required for remyelination.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","C57BL/6","female","10","Ozanimod","control",1,NA,"2",1.1,12,0.2,2.8,12,0.3,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"MR mri data was done in cuprizone model, but data not shown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"cuprizone","10","EAE","10","mouse","27","mice","16","female and male","histology","not reported","imaging","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,NA,"16","37","131","501","757","131 - 757","1 - 1181"

Thus, imaging strategies that specifically identify myeloid cells and their activation states are critical for MS disease staging and monitoring of therapeutic responses. We hypothesized that positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1) could be used to monitor deleterious innate immune responses and disease progression in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. We first validated TREM1 as a specific marker of proinflammatory, CNS-infiltrating, peripheral myeloid cells in mice with EAE. We show that the 64Cu-radiolabeled TREM1 antibody–based PET tracer monitored active disease with 14- to 17-fold higher sensitivity than translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO)–PET imaging, the established approach for detecting neuroinflammation in vivo. We illustrate the therapeutic potential of attenuating TREM1 signaling both genetically and pharmacologically in the EAE mice and show that TREM1-PET imaging detected responses to an FDA-approved MS therapy with siponimod (BAF312) in these animals.

Epidemiological, genetic, and biological evidence suggests that insufficient vitamin D may be an MS risk factor. However, little is known about how vitamin D might be protective in MS. We hypothesized that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] might regulate gene expression patterns in a manner that would resolve inflammation. To test this hypothesis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in mice, 1,25-(OH)2D3 or a placebo was administered, and 6 h later, DNA microarray hybridization was performed with spinal cord RNA to analyze the gene expression patterns. At this time, clinical, histopathological, and biological studies showed that the two groups did not differ in EAE disease, but changes in several 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive genes indicated that the 1,25-(OH)2D3 had reached the CNS. Compared with normal mice, placebo-treated mice with EAE showed increased expression of many immune system genes, confirming the acute inflammation. When 1,25-(OH)2D3 was administered, several genes like glial fibrillary acidic protein and eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha kinase 4, whose expression increased or decreased with EAE, returned to homeostatic levels. Also, two genes with pro-apoptotic functions, calpain-2 and caspase-8-associated protein, increased significantly. A terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nicked end labeling study detected increased nuclear fragmentation in the 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated samples, confirming increased apoptosis.

Human S1PR1 variants have been reported to have functional heterogeneity in vitro, suggesting that S1PR1 function may influence FTY720 efficacy. In this study, we examined the influence of S1PR1 phosphorylation on response to FTY720 in neuroinflammation. We found that mice carrying a phosphorylation-defective S1pr1 gene [S1PR1(S5A) mice] were refractory to FTY720 treatment in MOG(35-55)-immunized and Th17-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models. Long-term treatment with FTY720 induced significant lymphopenia and suppressed Th17 response in the peripheral immune system via downregulating STAT3 phosphorylation in both WT and S1PR1(S5A) mice.

This may be due to the fact that most EAE studies examine prophylactic, pre-treatment regimes that prove to be therapeutically-ineffective in long-established, often progressive, MS. FTY720 (fingolimod/Gilenya) is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator. This is a new oral agent that markedly reduces the number of relapses in people with MS, compared with currently licensed injectable agents such as the beta interferons. FTY720 has activity against lymphocytes but may also influence oligodendroglia and could therefore have the potential to influence progressive MS, by promoting remyelination. METHODS: The effect of FTY720 was assessed in relapsing-progressive EAE in mice. RESULTS: Early intervention during relapsing EAE could completely inhibit subsequent relapses, inhibited the accumulation of neurodegeneration, and facilitated motor recovery. However, when examined in secondary progressive EAE, that develops after the accumulation of deficit from relapsing disease, long-term treatment with FTY720 failed to slow deterioration when initiated late (4 months) into the disease course. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that early intervention with immunosuppressive agents may inhibit the generation of the neurodegenerative microenvironment, which is no longer responsive to potent immunosuppression. However, if treatment is initiated too late, progressive, neurological-disease continues unabated. This suggests that immunosuppression is insufficient to control secondary progression in animals, as has been found so far to be the case in MS, and may warrant early intervention with FTY720 for optimal treatment benefit.","no",NA,"IEB",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","Biozzi ABH","both","7","Fingolimod","control",1,NA,"1,2",1.25,9,0.1,3.25,9,0.35,"mean, SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"unclear","unclear","unclear","low","unclear","low","low","unclear","unclear","high",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","23","not reported","0","mice","8","mouse","3","female and male","histology","behaviour","not reported","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,"s.al-izki@qmul.ac.uk","13","35","86","48","411","86 - 411","1 - 687"

OBJECTIVE: As minocycline and hydroxychloroquine have been shown to inhibit microglia, we evaluated their effects on other outcomes relevant for progression. METHODS: Medications were evaluated in culture and in mice with acute and chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). RESULTS: Both medications individually reduced iron neurotoxicity and a combination effect was not observed. Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was manifested by minocycline only. Minocycline reduced T-cell proliferation more prominently than hydroxychloroquine; an aggregate effect occurred at low but not high concentrations. B-cell proliferation was mitigated to a greater extent by hydroxychloroquine and an additive effect was not evident. In EAE, suboptimal doses of minocycline and hydroxychloroquine individually delayed onset of clinical signs, while their combination suppressed clinical manifestations until treatment was stopped. In Biozzi ABH mice, a model of progressive MS, the chronic phase was beneficially altered using the combination.

RESULTS: We show that subcutaneously administrated anti-CD52 antibodies completely abolish EAE disease severity. CNS delivery of anti-CD52 antibodies during both the acute and chronic phases of EAE moderately reduces disease severity and the neuroinflammatory burden.

The compound is approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Cladribine can cross the blood-brain barrier, suggesting a potential effect on central nervous system (CNS) resident cells. Here, we explored compartment-specific immunosuppressive as well as potential direct neuroprotective effects of oral cladribine treatment in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. METHODS: In the current study, we compare immune cell frequencies and phenotypes in the periphery and CNS of EAE mice with distinct grey and white matter lesions (combined active and focal EAE) either orally treated with cladribine or vehicle, using flow cytometry. To evaluate potential direct neuroprotective effects, we assessed the integrity of the primary auditory cortex neuronal network by studying neuronal activity and spontaneous synaptic activity with electrophysiological techniques ex vivo. RESULTS: Oral cladribine treatment significantly attenuated clinical deficits in EAE mice. Ex vivo flow cytometry showed that cladribine administration led to peripheral immune cell depletion in a compartment-specific manner and reduced immune cell infiltration into the CNS. Histological evaluations revealed no significant differences for inflammatory lesion load following cladribine treatment compared to vehicle control. Single cell electrophysiology in acute brain slices was performed and showed an impact of cladribine treatment on intrinsic cellular firing patterns and spontaneous synaptic transmission in neurons of the primary auditory cortex. Here, cladribine administration in vivo partially restored cortical neuronal network function, reducing action potential firing. Both, the effect on immune cells and neuronal activity were transient.

Here we demonstrate efficacy of BTK inhibition in a model of secondary progressive autoimmune demyelination in Biozzi mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We show that late in the course of disease, EAE severity could not be reduced with a potent relapse inhibitor, FTY720 (fingolimod), indicating that disease was relapse-independent. During this same phase of disease, treatment with a BTK inhibitor reduced both EAE severity and demyelination compared to vehicle treatment. Compared to vehicle treatment, late therapeutic BTK inhibition resulted in fewer spinal cord-infiltrating myeloid cells, with lower expression of CD86, pro-IL-1β, CD206, and Iba1, and higher expression of Arg1, in both tissue-resident and infiltrating myeloid cells, suggesting a less inflammatory myeloid cell milieu. These changes were accompanied by decreased spinal cord axonal damage. We show similar efficacy with two small molecule inhibitors, including a novel, highly selective, central nervous system-penetrant BTK inhibitor, GB7208.

Minocycline ameliorates the clinical severity of MS and exhibits antiinflammatory, neuroprotective activities, and good tolerance for long-term use, whereas it is toxic to the CNS. Recently, the immunomodulation and neuroprotection capabilities of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) were shown in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this study, we evaluated whether the combination of hBM-MSCs and a low-dose minocycline could produce beneficial effects in EAE mice. METHODS: The sensitivity of hBM-MSCs to minocycline was determined by an established cell-viability assay. Minocycline-treated hBM-MSCs were also characterized with flow cytometry by using MSC surface markers and analyzed for their multiple differentiation capacities. EAE was induced in C57BL/6 mice by using immunization with MOG35-55. Immunopathology assays were used to detect the inflammatory cells, demyelination, and neuroprotection. Interferon gamma (IFN-<ce><b3>)/tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-<ce><b1>) and interleukin-4 (IL-4)/interleukin-10 (IL-10), the hallmark cytokines that direct Th1 and Th2 development, were detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed to elucidate the cell apoptosis in the spinal cords of EAE mice. RESULTS: Minocycline did not affect the viability, surface phenotypes, or differentiation capacity of hBM-MSCs, while minocycline affected the viability of astrocytes at a high dose. In vivo efficacy experiments showed that combined treatment, compared to the use of minocycline or hBM-MSCs alone, resulted in a significant reduction in clinical scores, along with attenuation of inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. Moreover, the combined treatment with hBM-MSCs and minocycline enhanced the immunomodulatory effects, which suppressed proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-<ce><b3>, TNF-<ce><b1>) and conversely increased anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10). In addition, TUNEL staining also demonstrated a significant decrease of the number of apoptotic cells in the combined treatment compared with either treatment alone.

Mouse brain tissue was histopathologically evaluated for myelin and oligodendrocyte loss, microglia/macrophage activation, and lymphocyte infiltration after six weeks of cuprizone exposure, and two weeks after discontinuation of cuprizone exposure. High and very high doses of vitamin D3 significantly reduced the extent of white matter demyelination (p<e2><80><8a>=<e2><80><8a>0.004) and attenuated microglia activation (p<e2><80><8a>=<e2><80><8a>0.001).

Thus, we hypothesized that mice with chronic EAE may also benefit from this combination therapy. We first assessed how a treatment with a single dose of GA together with daily application of EGCG may modulate EAE. Although single therapies with a suboptimal dose of GA or EGCG led to disease amelioration and reduced CNS inflammation, the combination therapy had no effects. While EGCG appeared to preserve axons and myelin, the single GA dose did not improve axonal damage or demyelination. Interestingly, the neuroprotective effect of EGCG was abolished when GA was applied in combination. To elucidate how a single dose of GA may interfere with EGCG, we focused on the anti-inflammatory, iron chelating and anti-oxidant properties of EGCG. Surprisingly, we observed that while EGCG induced a downregulation of the gene expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in affected CNS areas, the combined therapy of GA+EGCG seems to promote an increased HO-1 expression. These data suggest that upregulation of HO-1 may contribute to diminish the neuroprotective benefits of EGCG alone in this EAE model. Altogether, our data indicate that neuroprotection by EGCG in chronic EAE may involve regulation of oxidative processes, including downmodulation of HO-1.

In this study, a nanoformulation containing rhMBP with RTX on its surface (Nano-rhMBP-RTX) was prepared and investigated in comparison with other treatment groups to determine its potential neuro-protective effects on C57BL/6 mice after inducing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). METHODS: EAE was induced in the corresponding mice by injecting 100 <ce><bc>L of an emulsion containing complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). The subjects were weighed, scored and subjected to behavioural tests. After reaching a clinical score of 3, various treatments were given to corresponding EAE-induced and non-induced groups including rhMBP, RTX, empty nanoparticle prepared by poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) or the prepared nanoformulation (Nano-rhMBP-RTX).

RESULTS: The results of the Nano-rhMBP-RTX group showed promising outcomes in terms of reducing the clinical scores, improving the behavioural responses associated with improved histopathological findings. Elevation in the levels of IL-4, CNP and TGF-<ce><b2> was also noticed along with marked decline in the levels of NF-kB and TNF-<ce><b1>. CONCLUSION: Nano-rhMBP-RTX treated group ameliorated the adverse effects induced in the EAE model. The effectiveness of this formulation was demonstrated by the normalization of EAE-induced behavioral changes and aberrant levels of specific biochemical markers as well as reduced damage of hippocampal tissues and retaining higher levels of myelination.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","C57BL/6","male",NA,"Rituximab","control",1,NA,"2",1,8,0.7,4.6,8,0,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","88","not reported","0","mice","25","mouse","23","male","histology","behaviour","not reported","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","10.2147/IJN.S359114","ahmed.attia@pharma.cu.edu.eg","1","21","121","335","576","121 - 576","1 - 801"

Glatiramer acetate (GA) and interferon-<ce><b2>-1b (IFN-<ce><b2>-1b) are two immunomodulatory agents that have been shown to decrease the frequency of MS relapses. However, the question of whether these substances can slow neurodegeneration in MS patients is the subject of controversy.

For each substance, therapy was started 14 days before immunization, on the day of immunization, or on the day of clinical disease onset.

The function of RGCs was measured by electroretinograms. Although early GA or IFN-<ce><b2>-1b treatment showed benefit on disease activity, only treatment with GA exerted protective effects on RGCs, as revealed by measuring neurodegeneration and neuronal function.

Shamsi",2024,"Front Immunol","Ozanimod-mediated remission in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is associated with enhanced activity of CNS CD27(low/-) NK cell subset","BACKGROUND: Ozanimod (RPC1063) is an immunomodulator that has been recently approved by the FDA (2020) for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). It is a selective agonist of the sphingosine-1-phophate receptors 1 and 5, expressed on naïve and central memory T and B cells, as well as natural killer (NK) cells, and is involved in lymphocyte trafficking. Oral administration of ozanimod was reported to result in rapid and reversible reduction in circulating lymphocytes in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, however, only minimal effect on NK cells was observed. In this study, we sought to investigate the effect of ozanimod on NK cells and assess whether they play any role in ozanimod-induced remission in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS. METHODS: Active EAE induction was done in C57BL/6 female mice, followed by daily oral treatment with ozanimod (0.6mg/kg) starting at disease onset (score 1). Flow cytometry of blood and CNS was performed 24 hours after the last oral dose of ozanimod treatment in diseased mice. Histological analysis of lumbar spinal cord was performed for evaluating the level of inflammation and demyelination. Depletion of peripheral NK cells was done using anti-NK1.1 mouse antibody (mAb) at day 5 post-EAE induction. RESULTS: Ozanimod was effective in reducing the clinical severity of EAE and reducing the percentage of autoreactive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells along with significant inhibition of lymphocyte infiltration into the spinal cord, accompanied by reversed demyelination. Furthermore, ozanimod treatment resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of total NK cells in the blood and CNS along with upregulation of the activating receptor NKG2D on CD27(low/-) NK cell subset in the CNS. The effectiveness of ozanimod treatment in inhibiting the progression of the disease was reduced when NK cells were depleted using anti-NK1.1 mAb. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrated that ozanimod treatment significantly improved clinical symptoms in EAE mice. Ozanimod and anti-NK1.1 mAb appear to function in opposition to one another. Collectively, our data suggest that ozanimod-mediated remission is associated with an increased percentage of total NK cells and CD27(low/-) NK cells expressing the activating receptor, NKG2D in the CNS.","no",NA,"BVI",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","C57BL/6","female","11.5","Ozanimod","control",1,67,"2",0.5,10,0.5,2.5,10,1.2,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,"2011",NA,"EAE","55","not reported","0","mice","88","mouse","1","female","histology","behaviour","not reported","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","yes","10.3389/fimmu.2024.1230735","mshamsi@uaeu.ac.ae","1","98","162","78","514","162 - 514","1 - 761"

There is still lack of effective treatments currently. Pien Tze Huang (PZH), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, has been proved to have anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and immunoregulatory effects. However, whether PZH can be used to treat MS is still obscure. This study aimed to investigate the possible therapeutic effect and the underlying action mechanism of PZH in relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (RR-EAE) mice. Female SJL/J mice were immunized with myelin proteolipid protein 139-151 (PLP(139-151)) and pertussis toxin to establish RR-EAE model. Mice were then randomly divided into normal group, model group, PZH group and positive control group (fingolimod, FTY-720), and drugs were orally administered for 60 days from the day 10 after immunization. Sera of mice were collected for ELISA detection. Tissues of CNS were harvested for hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) and luxol fast blue (LFB) staining. Furthermore, Th1, Th17 cells and their related cytokines in the CNS were detected by flow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively. Proteins involved in STAT and NF-<ce><ba>B signaling pathways were detected by western blot. The results showed that PZH-treated mice displayed mild or moderate clinical symptoms compared with untreated EAE mice that exhibited severe clinical symptoms. PZH remarkably reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and myelin damage in the CNS of EAE mice. It markedly down-regulated the levels of IFN-<ce><b3> and IL-17A in sera of EAE mice. Moreover, PZH could reduce the percentages of Th1 and Th17 cells. It also suppressed the production of transcription factors ROR-<ce><b3>t and T-bet as well as the mRNA levels of their downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-<ce><b3> and IL-17A. Furthermore, PZH could inhibit the phosphorylation of some key proteins in the STAT and NF-<ce><ba>B signaling pathways. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that PZH had a therapeutic effect on RR-EAE mice, which was associated with the modulation effect on Th1 and Th17 cells.","no",NA,"PH",1,NA,"EAE","mouse","SJL","female","7","Fingolimod","control",1,40,"1",1.5,10,1.3,4.3,10,0.3,"mean, SD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mouse","Marketed",NA,"","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,"EAE","25","not reported","0","mice","42","rabbit","5","female","histology","behaviour","not reported","yes","No manual check required","yes","No manual check required","yes","Manual check recommended","yes","Manual check recommended","not reported","No manual check required","not reported","No manual check required","not reported",NA,"c(""hxj19@126.com"", ""aipinglu@hkbu.edu.hk"")","1","83","143","69","409","143 - 409","1 - 679"

Here, we investigated the effects of prophylactic GA treatment on the clinical course, histological alterations and peripheral immune cells in OSE. Objective: To investigate the effects of prophylactic glatiramer acetate (GA) treatment in a mouse model of spontaneous opticospinal encephalomyelitis (OSE). Methods: OSE mice with a postnatal age of 21 to 28 days without signs of encephalomyelitis were treated once daily either with 150 <c2><b5>g GA or vehicle intraperitoneally (i. p.). The animals were scored daily regarding clinical signs and weight. The animals were sacrificed after 30 days of treatment or after having reached a score of 7.0 due to animal care guidelines. We performed immunohistochemistry of spinal cord sections and flow cytometry analysis of immune cells. Results: Preventive treatment with 150 <c2><b5>g GA i. p. once daily significantly reduced clinical disease progression with a mean score of 3.9 <c2><b1> 1.0 compared to 6.2 <c2><b1> 0.7 in control animals (p < 0.01) after 30 d in accordance with positive effects on weight (p < 0.001). The immunohistochemistry showed that general inflammation, demyelination or CD11c(+) dendritic cell infiltration did not differ. There was, however, a modest reduction of the Iba1(+) area (p < 0.05) and F4/80(+) area upon GA treatment (p < 0.05). The immune cell composition of secondary lymphoid organs showed a trend towards an upregulation of regulatory T cells, which lacked significance. Conclusions: Preventive treatment with GA reduces disease progression in OSE in line with modest effects on microglia/macrophages.
